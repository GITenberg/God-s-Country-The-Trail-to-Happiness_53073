<h2><em>The First Trail</em><br />
MY SECRET OF HAPPINESS</h2>


<p class="dropcap">To-night I am in a little cabin in the
heart of a great wilderness. Outside it is
dark. I can hear the wind sighing in the thick
spruce tops. I hear the laughter of a stream
out of which I took my supper of trout. The
People of the Night are awake, for a little while
ago I heard a wolf howl, and, not far away, in
an old stub, lives an owl that hoots at the light
in my window. I think it’s going to storm.
There is a heaviness in the air, and, in the
drowse of it, the sweetness of distant rain.</p>

<p>I am strangely contented as I start the writing
of this strangest of all the things I have
written. I had never thought to give voice to
the things that I am about to put on paper; yet
have I dreamed that every soul in the world
might know of them. But the task has seemed
too great for me, and I have kept them within
myself, expecting them to live and die there.</p>

<p>I am contented on this black night, with its
promise of storm, for many reasons&mdash;though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
am in the heart of a peopleless forest fifteen
hundred miles from my city home. In the first
place, I have built, with my own hands, this
cabin that shelters me. My palms are still blistered
by the helve of the ax. I am the architect
of the fireplace of stone and mud in which a
small fire burns for cheer, though it is late
spring, with summer in the breath of the forests.
I have made the chair in which I sit and the
table on which I write, and the builder of a
marble palace could take no greater pleasure in
his achievement than have I.</p>

<p>I am contented because, just now, I have the
strange conviction that, in this wild and peopleless
place, I am very close to that which many
peoples have sought through many ages and
have not found.</p>

<p>In the distance, I can hear thunder, and a
flash of lightning illumines my window. A cry
of a loon comes with the flash. It is strange;
it is weird&mdash;and wonderful. And also, in a
way, it has just occurred to me that it is a fitting
kind of night to begin that which I have been
asked to write. For this night, for a short
space, will be like the great world at large&mdash;a
world that is rocking in the throes of a mighty
tumult&mdash;a tumult of unrest, of discontent, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
mad strivings, of despair, and lack of faith&mdash;a
world that is rushing blindfold into unknown
things, that is seeking rest and peace, yet can
never find them.</p>

<p>It is, I repeat, a strange night to begin the
writing of that which I have been asked to
write, and yet I do not think that I would have
the night changed. It seems to picture to me
more vividly the unrest of the world fifteen hundred
miles away&mdash;and fifteen thousand miles
away. I seem to see with clearer vision what
has happened during the past two years&mdash;the
mad questing of a thousand million people for a
spiritual thing which they cannot find. I see,
from this vantage-point of the deep forest, a
world torn by five hundred schisms and religions,
and I see not one religion that fills the
soul with faith and confidence. I see the multitudes
of the earth reaching up their arms and
crying for the Great Mystery of life to be
solved. Questions that are racking the earth
come to me in the whisperings of the approaching
storm. Can the ghosts of the dead return?
Can the spirits of the departed commune with
the living? Is the world on the edge of
an inundation of spiritualism? Does the
salvation of humanity lie there&mdash;or there&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
there? What shall I believe? What <em>can</em>
I believe?</p>

<p>The rain is beginning to beat on the roof of
my cabin and, in number, the drops of the rain
remind me of the millions and the tens of millions
of restless men and women who are reading
avidly, in the pages of magazines and books,
the “experiences” of those who are giving voice
to new creeds and new beliefs or reviving old
ones long lost in the dust of forgotten ages.</p>

<p>Ghosts have been revived; spirits are on the
move again. New generations are drinking in
with wonder and suspense the whole bagful of
tricks worn out ten thousand generations ago.
To-morrow it may be the revival of witchcraft.
And the next day new prophets may arise and
new religions take the place of the old. For
so travel the minds of men; and so they have
traveled for hundreds of thousands of years before
Christ was born and Christianity was
known; and so they will go on seeking until God
is found in a form so simple and intimate that
all humanity will at last understand.</p>

<p>The storm has broken. It is like a deluge
over the cabin. The thunder and crash of it is
in the spruce tops&mdash;and such is the dreadfulness
of the tumult and the aloneness of the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that I am in, that I would cease where I am did
I think that anything I am about to say might
be sacrilege. But when a mind gives expression
to that which it holds as truth, there cannot be
sacrilege.</p>

<p>I have been asked to put on paper something
of that religion which I have discovered
for myself in nature. There are many who
will laugh; there are many who will disbelieve,
for it will be impossible for me to make myself
entirely clear in such a matter as this. For I
have found what, to me, is God; and I cannot
expect to startle the world, even if I desired to
do so, for what I have found has been found
in a very simple way&mdash;without bringing spirits
back from the dead, or hearing voices out of
tombs, or gathering faith through the inspiration
of mediums.</p>

<p>I have found the heart of nature. I believe
that its doors have opened to me, and that I have
learned much of its language. Through adventure
and bloodshed I have come to a great understanding;
and understanding has brought me
health and faith and a joy in life. And because
these things will do the world no harm, and may
do some good, I am undertaking to write the
story of a great and inclusive God whom men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and women and little children should be made
to know, but to whom, unfortunately, the swift
pace of the times has made most of us
strangers.</p>

<p>I fear that I am going to shock many people,
and so I am of a mind to get the shock over with
and come to the meat of what I have to say.
But I shall start with something which those
who read this must concede&mdash;that everyone in
the world seems to be looking for something
which will bring him more comfort and more
happiness from life. That, I think, is the reason
the Catholic Church is the only Church
which is growing to any extent. It is growing
because it is the only Church which is holding
out its arms as a mother and giving a human
being a breast upon which to lay his head when
he is in trouble. Yet I am not a Catholic.
Neither am I a Protestant. I do not belong to
the High, Low, Broad, or Free Church. I do
not confess to Romanism, Popery, or Protestantism
any more than I do to Mohammedanism,
Calvinism, or the doctrines of the Latter-Day
Saints. I am not a sectarian any more than
I am a Shaker or a Restitutionist. I do not believe
that one necessarily goes to hell because he
does not accept Christ as the Son of God. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
believe that Christ was a good man and a great
teacher of his times, just as there have been
other good men and great teachers in their
times. I can look upon the Mussulman at
prayer, or the Parsee at his devotion, or the
Eskimo calling upon his unseen spirits with the
same feeling of brotherhood and understanding
that I can see a congregation of Baptists or
Methodists singing their praise to the God on
high. I do not pity or condemn the African
savage and the Indian of the Great Barrens
because they see their God through another
vision than that of the Christian. There were
many roads that led to old Rome. And there
are many roads, no matter how twisted and
dark they seem to us, that lead to the better
after-life.</p>

<p>I wish that some mighty power would rise
that could show to man how little and how insignificant
he is. Only therein, I think, could the
thorns and brambles be taken out of that path to
peace and contentment which he would like to
find, and would find if he were not blinded by
his own importance. He is the supreme egoist
and monopolist. His conceit and self-sufficiency
are at times almost blasphemous. He is the
human peacock, puffed up, inflated, flushed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the conviction <em>that everything in the universe
was made for him</em>. He looks down in supercilious
lordship on all other life in creation. He
goes out and murders millions of his kind with
his scientific inventions; yet he calls a tiger bad
and a pest because the tiger occasionally kills
the two-legged thing that hunts it. If he kills a
man illegally, it is called murder, and he is
hanged and goes to hell. If his government
tells him it is proper to kill a thousand men, he
kills them, and is called a hero&mdash;and a chosen
place is kept waiting for him in heaven. His
conceit blinds him to fact. He thinks our little
earth was the chosen creation of the Supreme
Power&mdash;forgetting that the earth is but a fly-speck
compared with the other worlds in space.
He thinks that Christ was born a long time ago,
and that time began with our own knowledge of
history&mdash;when, as a matter of fact, he has no
reason for disbelieving that man lived and died
hundreds of thousands of years ago, and that
countless religions have come and gone in the
eons of the past. He does not stop to reason
that, in number, he is as a drop in the ocean
compared with other beating hearts on earth.</p>

<p>To me, every heart that beats is a spark from
the breath of God. I believe that the warm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
beating heart in the breast of a singing robin is
as precious to the Creator of things as the heart
of a man counting money. I believe that a vital
spark exists in every blade of grass and in every
leaf of the trees. It is the great law of existence
that life must destroy in order to live, and
when destruction is inevitable and necessary, it
ceases to be a misdemeanor. But to let live,
when it is not necessary to destroy, is a beautiful
thing to consider.</p>

<p>Before men find a satisfying faith and peace,
they must come to see their own littleness.
They must discover that they are not <em>alone</em> in a
partnership with God, but that all manifestation
of life, whether in tree or flower or flesh
and blood, is a spark loaned for a space by that
Supreme Power toward which we all, in our individual
ways, are groping. There is one
teacher very close to us, as close to the poor as
to the rich, to show us this littleness and make
us understand. That teacher is nature&mdash;and, in
my understanding of things, all nature is rest
and peace. I believe that nature is the Great
Doctor, and, if given the chance, can cure more
ills and fill more empty souls than all the physicians
and preachers of the earth. I have had
people say to me that my creed is a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
one for a person as fortunately situated as myself,
but that it is impossible for the great multitudes
to go out and find nature as I have found
it. To these people, I say that one need not
make a two-thousand-mile trip along the Arctic
coast and live with the Eskimo to find nature.
After all, it is our nerves that kill us in the long
run, our over-restless minds, our worrying,
questing brains. And nature whispers its great
peace to these things even in the rustling leaves
of a corn field&mdash;if one will only get acquainted
with that nature. And my desire&mdash;my ambition&mdash;the
great goal I wish to achieve in my
writings is to take my readers with me into the
heart of this nature. I love it, and I feel that
they must love it&mdash;if I can only get the two
acquainted.</p>

<p>“Fine line of talk for a man whose home is
filled from cellar to garret with mounted heads
and furs,” I hear some of my good friends say.</p>

<p>Quite true, too. It is hard for one to confess
oneself a murderer, and it is still harder to explain
one’s regeneration. Yet, to be genuine, I
must at least make the confession, though it is
less the fact of murder than the fact of regeneration
that I have the inclination to emphasize,
now that I have the opportunity. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was a time when I took pride in the wideness
and diversity of my killings. I was a destroyer
of life. Now I am only glad that these killings
ultimately brought me to a discovery which is
the finest thing I have to contemplate through
the rest of my existence.</p>

<p>In my home are twenty-seven guns, and all
of them have been used. Many of the stocks
are scarred with tiny notches whereby I kept
track of my “kills.” With them, I have left red
trails to Hudson’s Bay, to the Barren Lands,
to the country of the Athabasca and the Great
Bear, to the Arctic Ocean, to the Yukon and
Alaska, and throughout British Columbia.
This is not intended as a pæan of triumph. It is
a fact which I wish had never existed. And
yet it may be that my love of nature and the
wild things, at the last, is greater because of
those reckless years of killing. I am inclined
to believe so. In my pantheistic heart, the
mounted heads in my home are no longer
crowned with the grandeur of trophies, but
rather with the nobility of martyrs. I love
them. I commune with them. I am no longer
their enemy, and I warm myself with the belief
that they know I am fighting for them now.</p>

<p>In this religion of the open, I have come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
understand and gather peace from the whispering
voices and even the silence of all God-loving
things. I have learned to love trees, and there
are times when I put my hands on them because
I love them, and rest my head against them because
they are comrades and their comradeship
and their might give me courage. There is a
gnarled old cripple of an oak in the yard of my
Michigan home, a broken and twisted dwarf
which many people have told me to destroy.
But that tree and I have “talked over” many
things together; it has pointed out to me how
to stand up under adversity, has shown me how
to put up a man’s fight. For, eaten to the heart,
a deformity among its kind, each spring and
summer saw it making its valiant struggle to
“do its best.” It was then I became its friend,
gave it a helping hand, stopped its decay and
death, and each season now the old oak is
stronger, and often I go out and sit with my
back against it, and I hear and understand its
voice, and I know that it is a great friend that
will never do me wrong.</p>

<p>It is thus that this religion of mine finds its
strength from the sources of great and unknown
power. But before it comes in all its
peace and joy, man must bring down his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
from out of the clouds of egoism, and say,
“The oak is as great as I&mdash;perhaps greater.”</p>

<p>Not long ago, it seemed to me that my world
had gone dark and that it would never grow
completely light again. In perhaps the darkest
hour, I flung myself down upon the ground close
to the bank of a stream. And then, close over
my head&mdash;so close I could have tossed a pebble
to it&mdash;a warbler near burst its little throat
in song. And the miracle of it was that it was
a dark and sunless day. But the warbler sang,
and then he chirped in the boughs above; and
when I looked at the ground beside me again, I
saw there, peeping up at me out of the grass, a
single violet. And the bird and the violet gave
me more courage and cleared my world for
me more than all the human friends who had
told me they were sorry. The violet said, “I
am still here; you will never lose me,” and the
little warbler said, “I will always sing&mdash;through
all the years you live.” And stronger
than ever came the faith in me that these things
were no more an accident of creation than man
himself.</p>

<p>Once I saw this Great Doctor of mine a
burning, vibrant force in a room of a crowded
tenement, from the roof of which one could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
not see a blade of grass or a tree. In fact, that
force filled three rooms, in which lived a man
and woman and five children. I spent an hour
in those rooms on a Sunday afternoon, and the
experience of that hour in a hot and crowded
tenement was a mightier sermon than was ever
preached to me in the heart of a forest. At
every window was a box in which green stuff
was growing. There were flowers in pots. A
pair of canary-birds looked down upon the
smoky roofs of a great city and sang. What interested
me most was two contrivances the man
had made to force oats into swift germination
and growth. In a week, he told me, the green
sprout of an oat would be two inches long.
Then I saw why they were grown. Several
times while I was there would a dove come to
a window and wait for a bit of the green. I
could see they were different doves. They told
me at least a dozen were accustomed to come in
that way. They were the children’s pets. A
little baby in arms cooed at them and waved his
arms in delight. I have seen many poor tenement
families, but that, I think, was the only
happy one. The singing of the birds, the coming
of the doves, the growing of green things
in their room were their inspiration, their hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the promise of dreams that would some day
come true. Nature had become their religion,
and yet they did not know it as such. It was
calling them out into the great open spaces&mdash;and
they were living in anticipation of that day when
they would answer the call.</p>

<p>Because I have spent much of my time in
adventuring in distant wildernesses, and exploring
where other men have not gone, it has been
accepted by many that my love for nature
means a love for the distant and, for most
people, the inaccessible wilds. It is true
that in the vast and silent places one comes
nearer, perhaps, to the deeper truths of
life. Of the wild and its miracles I love to
write, and when I come to that part of my story,
I shall possibly be happiest. But I would be
unfair to myself, and the religion of nature
itself, if the great truth were not first emphasized
that its treasures are to be possessed by
mankind wherever one may turn&mdash;even in a
prison cell. I was personally in touch with one
remarkable instance of this in the Michigan
State Penitentiary, at Jackson, where a canary-bird
and a red geranium saved a man from madness
and eventually gained him a pardon, sending
him out into the world a living being with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
new and better religion than he had ever
dreamed of before.</p>

<p>But the open skies and the free air were intended
from the beginning of things as the
greatest gifts to man, and it is there, if one is
sick in body or soul, that one should seek.
Whether it is a mile or a thousand miles from
a city makes little difference. For nature is the
universal law. It is everywhere. It is neither
mystery nor mysterious. Its pages are open; its
life is vibrant with the desire to be understood.
The one miracle is for man to bring himself
down out of the clouds of his egoism and replace
his passion for destruction with the desire
to understand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have in mind a case in point.</p>

<p>I had a very dear friend, a newspaper man,
whose wife had died. I don’t know that I ever
saw a man more utterly broken up, for his love
for her was more than love. It was worship.
He grew faded and thin, and a gray patch
over his temple turned white. The mightiest
efforts of his friends could do nothing. He
wanted to be alone, alone in his home, where
he could grieve himself to death by inches. I
knew that his case was harder because he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
merely tolerant of religion. One day, the idea
came to me that resulted in his spiritual and
physical salvation. I took him in my auto, and
we went out into the country four or five miles,
opened a gate, drove down a long lane, and
stopped at the edge of a forty-acre wood.</p>

<p>“Fred, I am going to show you a wonderful
city,” I said. “Come with me&mdash;quietly.”</p>

<p>We climbed over the fence, and I led him to
the heart of the wood, and there we sat down,
with our backs to a log.</p>

<p>“Now, just to humor me, be very still,”
I said. “Don’t move, don’t speak&mdash;just
listen.”</p>

<p>It was three o’clock in the afternoon, that
wonderful time of a summer day when nature
seems to rouse herself from midday slumber to
fill the world with her rustling life. The sun
fell slantwise through the wood, and here and
there, under the roofs of the trees, we could see
golden pools and streams of it on the cool
earth.</p>

<p>“This is one of the most wonderful cities
in the world,” I whispered, “and there are
hundreds and thousands of such cities, some of
them within the reach of all.”</p>

<p>The musical ripple of a creek came to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
ears. And then, slowly at first, there came upon
my friend the wonder of it all. He understood&mdash;at
last. About us, through all that forty
acres of wood, the air seemed to whisper forth
a strange and wonderful life. Over our heads,
we heard a grating sound. It was a squirrel
gnawing through the shell of a last autumn’s
nut. On an old stub, a woodpecker hammered.
Close about us were the “cheep, cheep, cheep,”
and “twit, twit, twit,” of little brown brushbirds.
A warbler burst suddenly into a glorious
snatch of song. A quarter of a mile away, a
crow cawed, and between us and the crow we
heard a fox-squirrel barking, and, a little later,
saw it, with its mate, scrambling in play up and
down the trees. My friend caught my arm and
pointed. He was becoming interested, and what
he saw was a fat young woodchuck passing near
us on a foraging expedition to a neighboring
clover field.</p>

<p>For an hour we did not move, and through
all that city was the drone and voice of life, and
that life was a soft and wonderful song, soothing
one almost to sleep. And when, at last, my
friend whispered again, “It sounds as though
everything is talking,” I knew that the spirit of
the thing had got into him. Then I drew his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
attention to a colony of big black ants whose
fortress was in the log against which we were
resting. They were working. Two of them
were trying to drag a dead caterpillar over my
friend’s knee. When we rose to go, I led him
past a little swale in which a score of blackbirds
had bred their young. On a slender willow,
a bobolink was singing. A land-turtle lumbered
back into the water, and the bright eyes
of green-headed frogs stared at us from patches
of scum. Under a bush, a score of toads were
teaching their tiny youngsters to swim. When
my friend saw the little fellows clinging to their
mothers’ backs, he laughed&mdash;the first time in
many months.</p>

<p>When we went back to the car, I said:</p>

<p>“You have seen just one ten-thousandth of
what nature holds for you and every other man
and woman. You haven’t believed in God very
strongly. But you’ve got to now. That’s God
back there in the wood.”</p>

<p>That was four years ago. To-day, that man
not only lives in the heart of nature but, from a
special assignment man, he has risen to the managing
editorship of a big metropolitan daily.
He has only his summer vacation in which to
get out into the big woods, but he has made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
room for nature all about him. From early
spring until late autumn, his front and back
yard fairly burst with life. And it is not, like
most yards, merely for show and passing pleasure
to the eyes. He has brought himself down
out of the clouds of man’s egoism, and is learning
and taking strength from nature&mdash;which he
now worships as the great “I am.” He has
developed a hobby for “interbreeding plants,”
as he calls it, and especially gladioli. Each
morning in spring and summer and autumn, he
goes out into his garden, and, from the thousand
living things there, he receives strength
for his nerve-racking duties of the day; and at
night, after his task is done, he returns to his
garden to seek that peace which is the great
and vibrant force of the life that is there. During
the months of winter, he has his little conservatory.
And this man&mdash;for more than thirty
years&mdash;hardly knew whether an oak grew from
an acorn or a seed!</p>

<p>Yet has he one great regret. And more than
once he has said to me, with that grief in his
voice which will never quite die out: “If we
had only found these things before, she would
be with me now. I am convinced of it. It was
this strength she needed to keep her from fading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
away&mdash;to build her up into joyous life again.
Sometimes I wonder why the Great Power that
is above did not let her live to go into the wood
with us that day.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hours have passed since I first sat down to
write these thoughts that were in my mind.
The storm has passed, and, following it, there
has come a marvelous silence. Both my door
and window are open, and there is rare sweetness
in the breath of the rain-washed air. I
can hear the near-by trees dripping. The creek
runs with a louder ripple. The moon is shimmering
through the fleecy clouds that are racing
south and east&mdash;toward my “civilized” home,
fifteen hundred miles away. Over all this world
of mine there is, just now, a vast and voiceless
quiet. And if I were superstitious, or filled with
the imagination of some of the prophets of old,
I am sure I would hear a Voice speaking out of
that mighty solitude, and it would say:</p>

<p>“O you mortal, blind&mdash;blind as the rocks
which make up the mountains!</p>

<p>“Blind as the trees which you think have
neither ears nor eyes!</p>

<p>“Made to see, yet unseeing; making mystery
out of that which was born with you; seeking&mdash;yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
seeking afar for that which lies close
at hand!</p>

<p>“You want peace. You go in quest of a
Breast mightier than all life to rest thy tired
head upon. And thy quest is like the drifting of
a ship without a rudder at sea. For you think
that the world is young because thou livest in
it now&mdash;and it is old, so old that thousands and
tens of thousands of peoples lived and died
before Christ was born. You think that civilization
has come to pass, and ‘civilization’ has
died a thousand times under the dust of the
ages. You believe you are treading the only
path to God&mdash;yet have a million billion people
died before you, unknowing the religions which
you now know.</p>

<p>“O you mortals of to-day, you are small and
near-sighted, and hard of hearing&mdash;even more
than they who lived a million years before you,
when the world was an hour or two younger
than now!</p>

<p>“What are you? Proud of thy purse, vain
of thy power, conceited in thy self-glorification&mdash;yet
you seek a simple thing and cannot
find it. You cannot find <em>rest</em>. You cannot find
<em>faith</em>. You cannot find <em>understanding</em>. You
cannot find that Breast mightier than all life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
upon which to rest thy head when the end comes
and when you go to join those trillions who
have gone before you.</p>

<p>“And, in your despair, you cry out that you
know not which way to turn, that you seek in
darkness, that the world is a wilderness of
schisms and religions, and that you cannot tell
which is the right and which is the wrong. For
you know that worlds have lived and died
through the eons of centuries before Christianity
was born. And you are oppressed by doubt
even as you grope!</p>

<p>“Yet you know deep in thy soul that the
heavens were not an accident. You know that
hundreds and thousands of worlds greater than
thine own have traveled their paths in space
for eternities. You know that the sun was set
in the skies so long ago that all the people of
the earth could not count the years of its life.
And you know that a Great Hand placed it
there. And that Hand, you say, was God.</p>

<p>“Yet you seek&mdash;and you seek&mdash;and you
seek&mdash;and doubt everlastingly clouds thine eyes;
and when darkness comes and you stand at the
edge of the Great Beyond, you look back, and&mdash;lo!&mdash;the
path you have traveled seems very
short, and it is cluttered with brambles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
thorns and the wreckage of shattered hopes and
wasted years.</p>

<p>“And then you see the Light!</p>

<p>“And, as thy spirit departs, the mystery unveils&mdash;the
answer comes.</p>

<p>“For that which you sought, you looked too
far. Close under thy feet and close over thy
head might you have found it!”</p>

<h2><em>The Second Trail</em><br />
I BECOME A KILLER</h2>


<p class="dropcap">This morning is a glory of sunshine and
peace after last night’s rain. It seems
inconceivable that the blue sky above the forest
was filled a few hours ago with the crash of
thunder and the blaze of lightning. I was up
at dawn, wakened by a pair of red squirrels
playing upon the roof of my cabin. Together we
watched the sun rise, and after that they chattered
about my open door while I prepared my
breakfast. We are becoming great friends.
One of them I have given the name of Nuts,
and for no reason in the world unless it is because
there are no nuts up here; and the other,
the sleek, beautiful little female, I call Spoony
because she looks at me so slyly, with her pretty
head perked on one side, as if flirting with
me.</p>

<p>It is only eight o’clock, yet we have been up
nearly four hours. At the edge of the creek,
less than a stone’s throw from the cabin, I have
built me a narrow table of smooth-hewn saplings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
between two old spruce trees, and this is my
open-air studio when the weather is fine. Word
of it has gone abroad, though I am many hundreds
of miles from civilization. Many kinds
of wild things have come to get acquainted with
me, fascinated chiefly, I think, by the marvelous
new language of my clicking typewriter. The
welcome and friendship of these little wilderness-hearts
are growing nearer and more apparent
to me every day; and with each day the
Great Truth speaks to me even more clearly
than the day before&mdash;that each of these beating
hearts, like my own, is a part of that nature
which I worship and is as vitally a spark of its
life as the heart which is beating inside my own
flannel shirt.</p>

<p>These friends of mine, gathering about me
more intimately and in greater number with
each passing day, are individuals to me because
I have come to understand them and know their
language. There is the Artful Dodger, for instance&mdash;I
sometimes call him Bill Sykes or Captain
Kidd&mdash;screaming close over my head this
very moment. In very intimate moments I call
him Arty, or Kid, or Bill. He is a big blue jay.
In spite of all that has been said and written
against him, I have a very brotherly affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for Bill. He is a man’s man, among birds, notwithstanding
that he occasionally breakfasts on
the eggs of other birds, and kills more than is
good for his reputation. Also, he is the greatest
liar and the biggest fraud and the most
brazen-faced cheat in the bird kingdom. But I
know Bill intimately now, where I used to kill
him as a pest, and I love him for all his sins.</p>

<p>He is a pirate who never loses his sense of
humor. He is always raising a disturbance just
for the excitement of it, and when he has drawn
a crowd, so to speak, he will slip slyly away
to some nearby vantage-point and laugh and
chuckle over the rumpus he has raised. Right
now, he is screaming himself hoarse forty feet
above my head. Two others have joined him,
and they are making such a bedlam of sound
that Nuts and Spoony have ceased their chattering.
There!&mdash;I have fired a stick at them,
and they are gone. They have had their joke,
and are quite satisfied&mdash;for the present.</p>

<p>I can hear the musical rippling of the creek
again, now that Bill and his blustering pals are
gone, and my typewriter is like a tiny machine
gun sending its clicking notes out into the still
forest. A pair of moose-birds, almost as big as
the jays, are hopping about, so near that, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
times, they are perched on the end of my sapling
table. They are the tamest birds in the wilderness,
and within another day or so will be eating
out of my hand. Unlike the jays, they make no
disturbance. They are soft and quiet, never
making a sound, and their big, beautiful eyes
fairly pop with their intense interest in me. I
like their company, because there is a philosophy
about them. They never tire of looking at me,
and studying me, and at times I have the very
pleasant fancy that they are bursting with a desire
to speak. They are very gentle, and never
fight or scold or commit any sins that I know
of; and just now, as the two look at me with
their big soft eyes, I find myself wondering
which of us is of most account in the final
analysis of things.</p>

<p>Ten or fifteen rods above me, the creek
widens and forms a wide pool overhung with
trees, so that, in the hottest weather, it must
be a delightfully refreshing place. I can see it
plainly from where I am sitting, for the creek
twists a little, so that it is running directly
toward me when I look in that direction. Many
wild things come to that pool. This morning,
I found a bear-track there, and the fresh hoof-prints
of a doe and fawn. Yesterday, a pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of traveling otters discovered it, but when I tried
them out with the voice of my typewriter, they
turned back. I am confident they will return,
and that we shall get acquainted.</p>

<p>At the present moment, in looking toward
the pool, I am struck by what at first thought
I might consider a discordant note in this wonderland
of quiet and peace that is about me.
At the edge of the pool, rigid and watchful, a
hawk is poised on a dead limb projecting from
a lightning-struck stub. He is hungry and eager
to kill. I have seen him launch himself twice
after a victim, but each time without success.
Finally, he will succeed. He will kill a living
thing that he himself may continue to live. Yet
I have no inclination to shoot him. For to live,
and to cherish that spark of life that is in him, is
as much his right as it is mine. He is not, like
man, a killer for the love of killing. He wants
his breakfast.</p>

<p>And in fairness to him I think of two tender
young spruce-partridges which I shot late last
evening, and which I shall roast for my dinner,
along with a potato and a flavor of bacon. My
religion does not demand vegetarianism any
more than it does flesh; for that, too, is life.
For the trees whispering above me now are as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
alive to me as the moose-birds perched at the
end of my table, yet when necessity comes I cut
them down with an ax, and make a cabin or cook
my food with them. All nature cries out that
life must exist upon life, that one tree must grow
upon the mold of another, that for each green
blade of grass another blade must die. It is not
against a wise and necessary destruction that the
God of all nature cries out. The crime&mdash;the
crime greater than all other crimes&mdash;is destruction
without cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That is what I must come to now, even in this
glory of peace that is whispering about me&mdash;I
must face the task of confessing my own sins as
a killer, as a destroyer of life for the love and
thrill of killing. I was born, like all the children
of men, a monumental egoist. My parents
were egoists. My forefathers for ten
thousand generations were egoists before me,
and I was the last product of their egoism&mdash;one
of the billion and a half people who
are living to-day in the blindness of a self-conceit
that has filled their worlds with schisms
and religions as false and as unstable as the
treacherous sands of human “almightiness”
upon which they have been built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>From the beginning, I did not need argument
or education to tell me that I was the greatest
of all created things&mdash;that my particular brand
of life, of all life on the earth, was the only
life that God had intended to be inviolate.
That fact was pounded home to me in the public
schools; it was preached to me in the
churches. I was part and parcel of the great
“I Am.” For me, all the universe had been
built. For me, the Great Hereafter was solely
created. All other life was merely incidental,
and created especially for my benefit. It was
mine to do with as I pleased. In a mild sort
of way, the school and the church told me to
have a little charity, and not to “hurt the poor
little birdies.”</p>

<p>But church and school did not tell me, and
has never told its pupils, that all other life on
the earth was as precious as my own, and had
an equal right to fight for its existence. It is
true I was told that never a sparrow falls that
God does not see it, but it is also true that, for
six years, my state urged its children to kill sparrows
for a bounty of two cents a head. I found
no course in school or college that attempted
to teach me that the spark of life animating my
own body was no different from the sparks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
which animated all other living things. Both religion
and school instilled into me that I was
next in place to God. All other life, from the
life of trees and flowers to that of beasts and
birds, was put on earth for my special benefit.
No other life had a right to exist unless the
human egoist saw fit to let it live. And all this
simply because human life happened to be the
most powerful life, and cleverest in the art and
science of destroying other life.</p>

<p>I wonder what would happen if for ten generations
the churches and schools would teach
their little children and their grown-ups that
there is a heaven for flowers and trees and birds
and butterflies just as surely as there is a heaven
for man! What would happen if the teaching
of the Great Truth of nature began in the
kindergarten, and went on through the lives of
men and women, growing stronger in the race
as generation added itself to generation? It is
something to think about in these days when, in
our madness for a faith, we are reviving ghosts
and phantom voices and are frightening our
children again with the diseased and weird belief
that the spirits of the dead can come back
to us. We want something that is clean and
healthy and inspiring, something that is beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to contemplate, and which is not an overwhelming
insult to that Great Power of the universe
of which we are so small a part&mdash;and in
the kindergarten we could plant the seed of
that thing, so that, through the school and the
church and all life, it would continue to grow
stronger with each generation, until, at last,
man would shake off that deadliest of all his
enemies, his own egoism and self-conceit.
Then, and not until then, will he find contentment
and peace and happiness in the brotherhood
of all other life that is about him.</p>

<p>But I seem to be evading the issue&mdash;my own
confession as a monumental egoist and a killer.
I have said that my parents were egoists, like
all their forefathers before them. Yet the
world never held a better mother than mine.
I do not except any who may sit in heaven at
the present time. And my father, as a man, was
far better than his son will ever be. He was a
gentleman of the old school, living, as he died,
an example of courage and fearlessness and
honor to all who knew him. Yet did these two
splendid people, like all other parents, foster
and cultivate my egoism from the beginning.
They did it unconsciously, blindly, as hundreds
of millions of other parents are doing to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>My father loved hunting and fishing, and at
eight years of age I possessed my own gun. I
remember with what pride he taught me to
shoot and to stalk my first living victims; and
when we returned from a hunt, if I had killed
anything, it was always to me that my beloved
mother gave her greatest attention and commendation.
We lived on an Ohio farm then,
and I became a sort of boy prodigy in the art of
hunting. When I was nine years old, a newspaper
in a near-by city published a story of my
prowess, and I do not think I was more puffed
up over it than my father himself. By the time
I was twelve, I had lost all respect for that life
which the laws of our state said I might take. I
had a fine collection of birds’ eggs, and another
“splendid” collection of birds’ wings. My
room was decorated with the wings.</p>

<p>I always recall with an odd sort of feeling
that at this particular height of my boyish
slaughter of life I “got religion,” and got it
hard. At Joppa, a “four-corners” two miles
from our farm, a series of revival meetings
was going on that winter, and I cannot remember
anyone in all our community who did not get
the religious fever, except most of the youngsters.
But it hit me hard. I felt that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
actually inspired. So deeply did the excited
preachings effect my mind that frequently, when
I was alone, I felt that angels were with me.
One moonlight night, in returning from a revival,
I actually saw an angel, and the beautiful
thing with white wings and white raiment
and wonderful flowing hair walked halfway
home with me. When I told that story at
school the next day, and insisted that it was true,
I had five different fights. My mother said that
it probably was true, for she was delighted that
I had become religious. So I fought, and
licked&mdash;and got licked&mdash;for about a month because
of my faith.</p>

<p>But what I am coming to is this: Though
practically our whole township was converted,
at no time did this religion tell me to stop killing.
So inspired was I that Mr. Teachout, the
revivalist, had me give a short “sermon” one
evening&mdash;and I recall vividly how, in “introducing”
me, he said, in a loud voice and with
a great flourish of his arms, that I “was the
best hunter in all Erie County and could kill
more game in a day than almost any grown
hunter there.” Whereupon there was a mighty
applause from the hundred people present, and
I was the proudest youngster in Ohio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because from a church rostrum I was hailed
as the greatest boy killer in that county! No
one of all those Christians told me that I should
stop killing. They made a hero of me because
I was already becoming a master in the art of
killing. They built up my egoism to a point
where it became blasphemous&mdash;to a point where
it more than offset my mother’s pleadings that
I stop shooting birds for their wings. Then
came a thing which, as I look back upon it now,
seems to me monstrous. There was to be a big
“hunters’ supper” to end the revival. The
men chose sides, and on a certain day all these
men set out to kill. They were to kill nothing
“outside the law.” But all life not protected
by law might be sacrificed. I remember that a
rabbit counted five points, a squirrel four, a
hawk six, a blue jay two, and so on. The side
that lost out on “points,” or, in other words, destroyed
the least life, was compelled to furnish
the supper. How I did slaughter! When I
came in to the “count” that night, my game-bag
was filled to the brim with dead things.
Among other creatures I had killed seventeen
blue jays! Any wonder that Captain Kidd and
his pals screamed over my head this morning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet good Christian people still regard
with horror the day when pagan Rome burned
the martyrs.</p>

<p>My education in the art of destruction increased
as my years grew in number. I was
not alone. All the human world was destroying,
just as it is destroying to-day. We moved
back to the little city of Owosso, in Michigan,
where I was born. In Erie County, Ohio, my
nickname had been Slippery&mdash;just why I don’t
know; now, in Michigan, it became Nimrod and
Wildcat Jim. I haunted our beautiful Shiawassee
River as ghosts are now haunting some of
our scientific writers. I trapped and hunted and
fished more than I studied&mdash;so much more, in
fact, that I became decidedly unpopular with
our high-school principal, Mr. Austin, who is
now my very good friend. At last, I stood at
the splitting of the ways&mdash;and I chose my own
course. I trapped a season, and, with the
money earned, started in on a special course at
the University of Michigan. Things went
well. I slipped through college with the
ease of an eel, took up newspaper work in
Detroit, became a special writer and a magazine
writer and the youngest metropolitan newspaper
editor in Michigan. I felt inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to believe that I was a wild and uproarious
success.</p>

<p>But under it all burned my desire to get back
to my old job of destruction, and this desire led
me into my long years of adventuring into the
far northern wildernesses.</p>

<p>As I sit here now, clicking my typewriter in
the still heart of the forest, it is a wonder to
me that some colossal spirit of vengeance does
not rise up out of it and destroy me. And yet,
when I consider, I know why that vengeance
does not come&mdash;and in the face of this “great
reason,” I see my littleness as I have never
seen it before. It is because, very slowly, my
egoism is crumbling away. And as it crumbles,
my big brother&mdash;all nature&mdash;grips my hand
ever more closely, and whispers to me to tell
others something of what I have found. And
that big brother is not only the spirit of the
heart-beating things about me, but also the spirit
and voice of the trees, of the living earth that
throbs under my feet, of the flowers, the sun,
the sky. It is all reaching out to me with a
great show of friendliness, and I seem to feel
that fear and misunderstanding have slipped
away from between us. It is inviting me to
accept of it all that I may require, yet to cherish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that which I cannot use. It is telling me, as it
has whispered to me a thousand times before,
the secret of life; that the life in my own breast
and all this that is about me are one and the
same&mdash;and that, in our partnership for happiness,
we each belong to the other. And there
must be no desire for vengeance between us.</p>

<p>Yet, to me, it does not seem like justice, looking
at it from the warped and narrow point of
view of my human mind. It is the human instinct
to demand an eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth. And I cannot see why my God of
nature should give me such reward of peace
and friendship after what I have done. It has
always been my logic that life is the cheapest
thing in existence. There is just so much earth,
so much water, so much air about us; but of life
there is no end. So we go on destroying. If
nature would keep this destroyed life unto herself
for a few generations, instead of giving it
back to us in her unvengeful way, the earth
would soon become a desert. Then we would
learn our lesson.</p>

<p>I am thinking, as I write this, of a beautiful
little forest in a wonderful valley in the heart
of the British Columbia mountains. It was a
glorious thing to look down upon that day when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
I destroyed it. I call it a forest, though there
was not more than an acre of it, or two at the
most. And the valley was really a “pocket”
among the mighty peaks of the Firepan Range.
It was of balsams and cedars, rich green, and
densely thick&mdash;a marvelous patch of living
tapestry, vibrant with the glow and pulse of life
in the sunset of that day. Into its shelter we
had driven a wounded grizzly which had refused
to turn and fight. And so thick and protecting
was the heart of it that we could not get
the grizzly out. Night was not far away, and in
its darkness we knew our game would escape us.
And the thought came to us to burn that little
paradise of green. There was no danger of a
spreading fire. The mountain walls of the
“pocket” would prevent that. And it was I
who struck the match!</p>

<p>In twenty minutes, the little forest was a sea
of writhing, leaping flame. It cried out and
moaned in the agony of conflagration. The
bear fled from its torture and its ruin, and we
killed him. That night, the moon shone down
on a black and smoldering mass of ruin where
a little while before had been the paradise.</p>

<p>In our camp, we laughed and exulted. The
egoism of man made us feel our false triumph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
What it had taken a thousand years to place in
that cup of the mountains we had destroyed in
half an hour&mdash;yet we felt no regret. We had
destroyed a thousand times more life than filled
our own pitiable bodies, yet did the false ethics
of our breed assure us that we had done no
wrong&mdash;simply because the life we had destroyed
had not possessed a form and tongue
like our own.</p>

<p>“This man must be losing his reason,” I hear
some of my readers say. Is it that, or is a bit
of reason just returning to me, after a million
years of sleep? If it is madness, it is of a kind
that would comfort the world could all be mad
as I am mad. Life is Life. It is a spark of the
same Supreme Power, whether in a tree, a
flower, or a thing of flesh and blood. To me,
as I view it now, the wanton destruction of that
little paradise was as tragic as the destruction
of life carried about on two legs or four. I
feel that the crime of its destruction was as
great as that of another day which I recall most
vividly in these moments.</p>

<p>I was in another wonderland of the northern
mountains, and my companion was a grizzled
old hunter who had learned the art of killing
through a lifetime of experience. With our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
pack-outfit of seven horses, we were hitting for
the Yukon over a trail never traveled by white
man before. So glorious was the valley we
were in on this day of which I write that at
noon we struck our camp. So awesome was the
vastness and beauty of it that my soul was held
spellbound with the magic of it. On all sides
of us rose the mighty mountains, with snow-crowned
peaks rising here and there out of the
towering ranges. The murmur of rippling
water filled the soft air with soothing song;
green meadows, sweet with the perfume of wild
hyacinths, violets, and a hundred other flowers,
carpeted the rich earth about us; on the sun-warmed
rocks, whistlers lay in fat contentment,
calling to one another like small boys whistling
between their teeth; the slopes were dotted with
ptarmigan; a pair of eagles soared high above
us, and from the patches and fingers of timber
came the cry and song of birds. With my back
propped against a pile of saddles and panniers
I carefully scanned the slides and slopes
through my hunting-glasses. High up on the
crag of a mountain-shoulder, I picked up a
nanny-goat feeding with her kid. Still farther
away, on a green “slide” at least two miles
from camp, I discovered five mountain-sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
lying down. And after that, swinging my
glasses slowly, I came to something which sent
a thrill through my blood. It was a mile away,
a great, slow-moving hulk that I might have
mistaken for a rock had my eyes not been
trained to the ways and movement of game. It
was a grizzly.</p>

<p>Alone I went after him, armed with man’s
deadliest weapon of extinction, a .405 Winchester.
Inside of half an hour I was well in
the teeth of the breeze coming up the valley,
and almost within gunshot of my victim. I
came to a coulee and crept up that, and when
I reached the table-land meadow where it began,
a thousand feet above the valley, I found
myself within a hundred yards of the grizzly.</p>

<p>He was digging like a dog for a gopher. And,
then, suddenly, my heart gave a thump that
almost choked me. In a twist of the mountain-bench,
not more than seventy or eighty yards
above me, were two more grizzlies. I hesitated,
and looked back down the coulee, for a
moment doubtful whether to retreat or declare
war. Then I decided. In my hands was
a killer of the deadliest and surest kind. I was
an expert shot and my nerves were steady. I
began. I think I fired five shots in perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
thirty seconds, and the three big grizzlies died
almost in their tracks. A conqueror returning
in his triumph to old Rome could not have been
more elated than I. I remember that I leaped
and danced and shrieked out at the top of my
voice in the direction of camp. I was mad with
joy. Three thousand pounds of flesh and blood
lay hot and lifeless under my eyes, and I, the
human near-god, with my own two insignificant
hands and a mechanical thing, <em>had taken the
life from it</em>!</p>

<p>I sat down on one of the huge carcasses that
still breathed under me. I wiped my face, and
my blood was running a race that heated me as
if with fire. And the thought came to me:
“Oh, if the world could only see me now&mdash;here
in my glorious triumph&mdash;with these great beasts
about me!” For it was a mighty triumph for
man, the egoist. In thirty seconds I had destroyed
a possible one hundred years of throbbing,
heart-beating life, a hundred years of winter,
a hundred years of summer, a hundred
mating-seasons, and the thousand other lives
that now would never be born! I stood up, and
shrieked again toward the camp, and far above
me out of the blue of the sky I heard an answering
cry from one of the eagles....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, as I sit here, looking back over the days
that are gone, I wonder that the spirit of
vengeance does not rise up out of the forest and
destroy me, even as I have destroyed. It would
be justice, according to that justice which man
the egoist metes out. And yet, even as I
wonder, the answer comes to me very clearly.
I am no different than hundreds of millions of
others. I have destroyed in my own way, while
others have destroyed in theirs. And nature,
the most blessed of all things, is not vengeful.
God forgives. And nature is God. It is God
that lives in the rose, in the violet, in the tree,
just as he lives in the heart of man. It is God
that breathes in the grass which makes the earth
sweet to tread upon, and it is God that lives in
the song of birds. His “life” is all-encompassing,
the vital spark of all existent things. Instead
of sending ghosts back to earth to prove
his power, he gives us all these things, and lives
and breathes in them, that we may have him
with us in physical things all the days of our
lives if we will only rise out of our egoism&mdash;and
understand.</p>

<p>And now I have come again to the parting
of a way. I have bared the black side of my
ledger, and it has not been pleasant work for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
me. To-morrow begins the joyous part of
my task&mdash;the beginning of that story which
will tell how at last my eyes were opened, how
understanding came to me, and with that understanding
a new faith which will live with me
through all the rest of the years of my life.</p>

<h2><em>The Third Trail</em><br />
MY BROTHERHOOD</h2>


<p class="dropcap">To-day is Sunday, and I have just returned
from a week’s hike up the mysterious
little creek that runs past my cabin. It
seems good to be home again, and Nuts and
Spoony and Wild Bill, the blue jay, have given
me a royal welcome, and I am almost convinced
my pop-eyed moose-bird friends are trying to
tell me who was the thief in my cabin while I
was gone. On that “to-morrow” when I had
promised myself another day of writing, the
<em>Wanderlust</em> came to me, and I packed up a kit
and a week’s supply of grub and started out to
explore my creek. It is a very individual sort of
creek&mdash;it has character, even, if it hasn’t a
name. It comes out of deep, dark, and unexplored
masses of forest to the north, and I
have fancied it bringing down all sorts of romance
and tragedy out of the hidden places if
it could only talk. So I went to the end of it to
find out its secrets for myself. And there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
so much of interest that I could fill a book with
it. I don’t think any other white feet have ever
traveled up this creek, which I now call “Lonesome.”
Surely not even an Indian has been
along it for at least a generation, for I did not
find the mark of an ax or sign of a fire or vestige
of deadfall or trap-house.</p>

<p>But it did take me forty miles back into a
country of such savage wilderness and dense
forests that I have almost determined to build
me another cabin there a little later, if for no
other reason than to live for a while with the
hundreds of owls that inhabit certain parts of it.
I have never seen so many owls anywhere in the
Northland, and I figure this is because the big
snow-shoe rabbits have been multiplying for
several years past, and now exist there literally
in thousands. At many places along the creek,
the earth was beaten hard by their furred feet.
By all the signs, I have predicted that next
year, or the year after, the “seven-year rabbit-plague”
will come along and kill off ninety out
of every hundred. Then the owls will scatter,
and most of the lynxes and foxes and wolves will
wander off into other hunting grounds, for the
rabbit is the staff of life of the flesh-eating
birds and beasts of the big northern forests, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as all the world over wheat is the mainstay of
human stomachs.</p>

<p>But I am wandering a bit from the point in
mind&mdash;which is to say that, in leaving on my
journey of exploration, I forgot to close the
window of my cabin, and through that open window
entered the rascally thief whom the pair of
moose-birds are trying to tell me about. I
think Bill knows also, but I don’t believe he
would give a brother robber away, even if he
did have four feet and a tail. By tracks and
two or three other signs, I know the thief is a
wolverine, who, like the pack-rat over in the
mountains, steals almost entirely for the fun of
it. This mischief-making humorist, among
other things, has carried away a hat, one of
my two frying-pans, several tins, half a slab of
bacon, and my favorite fish-cleaning knife during
my absence. But I know this clever fellow’s
ways, and have hope that I shall soon
recover my property if I keep my eyes open and
listen with both my ears.</p>

<p>And I shall not kill him, no matter how red-handed&mdash;or
red-footed&mdash;I catch him. A few
years ago, I would have planned to ambush him
with a rifle. But now I have the desire to
become as intimate with him as possible and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
learn a little more definitely what he wants with
a knife, a skillet, and my pans. I feel that, for
his theft, he should in some way be rewarded
and not slain, for he has added to my interest
in life by rousing a keen and harmless curiosity.
His is only one way in which nature is
constantly adding fullness of life and greater
contentment to my years. Everywhere, even
to the smallest things under my feet and at my
hand, I am learning more and more of the marvelous
ways and life of all creation, and the
more I learn the more I am convinced that I am
simply an atom in its vast brotherhood, and I
am finding a great happiness by making myself
actually a part of it.</p>

<p>Heretofore, I have been a self-expatriated
spark of life, so to speak; in my human egoism,
I have held myself apart from all other sparks
of life that were not formed in my own poor
and unlovely shape&mdash;and, even then, I considered
myself considerably better than those
who did not happen to be of my particular color
and breed.</p>

<p>Two very simple things are adding to my
pleasure in life this early afternoon, and illustrate
the point I have in mind&mdash;if one can bow
one’s head down to the level of understanding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I am writing again between the two big spruce
trees, but during my week of absence other
sparks of life have, in a way, taken possession
of my table. From between two of the hewn
saplings that form the top of this table, where
the big storm of wind must have flung a bit of
earth and a seed, a tender green sprout of something
has started to grow. It is a single spear
now, not of grass, and its green is the whitish
green of the lower part of an asparagus shoot.
To me, it seems fairly to pulse with life, and I
have the very foolish feeling within me that
nature planned this little surprise for me while
I was away, and that, if I give it a bit of
brotherly attention, I am going to have a flower
on my table, not transplanted or plucked, but
there deliberately through friendship for me.
However foolish this notion may be, it is a very
pleasant one to have, and its effect is to bring
me much nearer to the Creator of things than
any sermon I could hear preached from a pulpit;
for I am not listening merely to words
about God, but I am looking directly at a
physical part of God, and I find a great satisfaction
in this faith.</p>

<p>A second interesting thing that has happened
to my table is that it has become a plain across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
which now runs the trail of a big tribe of ants.
These ants, I have found, climb up the farthest
right-hand support of my table and proceed
straight across to the big spruce on my left, up
which they disappear; and a returning file of
the workers come down the spruce and hit it
“cross-country” to the table-leg again. They
don’t seem to be bearing any burdens, yet they
move with precision and purpose, and I have
come to understand that, when ants move in
this way, they have something very definite in
mind. I am convinced they are moving from
one fortress home to another, or at least that
every “working” individual in the tribe is personally
investigating some new discovery that
has been made either up the spruce or in the
direction of the creek. Later, I will know more
about it.</p>

<p>But the point that impresses itself upon me
most is that, in my destroying days, I would
have swept the friendly little green sprout from
its cradle, and would have driven the ant tribe
from my property, destroying as many of them
as possible. Again I want to emphasize that
I am not a crank, or narrow-minded in my religion
of “live and let live.” If this same tribe
of ants had invaded my cabin, and were preying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
on things necessary to me, I would destroy them
or drive them away. That is my nature-given
privilege&mdash;to protect myself and what is mine.
It is also the privilege of every other spark of
life. These same ants, were I to stand on their
fortress, would attack me desperately. But now
they do not molest me. And I do not molest
them. It is the beautiful law of “live and let
live”&mdash;so long as the necessity for destruction
does not arise.</p>

<p>When I sat down at my typewriter an hour
ago, I had planned to begin immediately the
telling of what I have wandered somewhat
away from&mdash;the story of a few incidents which
helped to bring about my own regeneration, and
which at last impressed upon me this great
Golden Rule of all nature&mdash;live and let live.
The big dramatic climax in that part of my life
happened over in the British Columbia mountains,
where my love of adventure has taken me
on many long journeys.</p>

<p>But the change had begun to work in me before
then. My conscience was already stabbing
me. I was regretting, in a mild sort of
way, that I had killed so much. But I was still
the supreme egoist, believing myself the God-chosen
animal of all creation, and when at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
time I withheld my destroying hand, I flattered
myself with a thought of my condescension and
human kindness.</p>

<p>At the particular time I am going to write
about, I was on a big grizzly-hunt in a wild
and unhunted part of the British Columbia
mountains. I had with me one man, seven
horses, and a pack of Airedales trained to hunt
bear. We had struck a grizzly-and-caribou
paradise, and there had been considerable killing,
when, one day, we came upon the trail of
Thor, the great beast that showed me how small
in soul and inclination a man can be. In a
patch of mud his feet had left tracks that were
fifteen inches from tip to tip, and so wide and
deep were the imprints that I knew I had come
upon the king of all his kind. I was alone that
morning, for I had left camp an hour ahead
of my man, who was two or three miles behind
me with four of the horses and the Airedale
pack. I went on watching for a new campsite,
for the thrill of a great desire possessed
me&mdash;the desire to take the life of this monster
king of the mountains. It was in these moments
that the unexpected happened. I came over a
little rise, not expecting that my bear was within
two or three miles of me, when something that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was very much like a low and sullen rumble
of far-away thunder stopped the blood in my
veins.</p>

<p>Ahead of me, on the edge of a little wallow
of mud, stood Thor. He had smelled me, and,
I believe, it was the first time he had ever
smelled the scent of man. Waiting for this
new mystery in the air, he had reared himself
up until the whole nine feet of him rested on
his haunches, and he sat like a trained dog,
with his great forefeet, heavy with mud, drooping
in front of his chest. He was a monster in
size, and his new June coat shone a golden
brown in the sun. His forearms were almost
as large as a man’s body, and the three
largest of his five knifelike claws were five and
a half inches long. He was fat and sleek and
powerful. His upper fangs, sharp as stiletto-points,
were as long as a man’s thumb, and between
his great jaws he could have crushed the
neck of a caribou. I did not take in all these
details in the first startling moments; one by one
they came to me later. But I had never looked
upon anything in life quite so magnificent. Yet
did I have no thought of sparing that splendid
life. Since that day, I have rested in camp with
my head pillowed on the arm of a living grizzly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that weighed a thousand pounds. Friendship
and love and understanding have sprung up between
us. But in that moment my desire was to
destroy this life that was so much greater than
my own. My rifle was at my saddle-horn in
its buckskin jacket. I fumbled it in getting into
action, and in those precious moments Thor
lowered himself slowly and ambled away. I
fired twice, and would have staked my life that
I had missed both times. Not until later did I
discover that one of my bullets had opened a
furrow two inches deep and a foot long in the
flesh of Thor’s shoulder. Yet I did not see
him flinch. He did not turn back, but went his
way.</p>

<p>Shame burns within me as I write of the
days that followed; and yet, with that shame,
there is a deep and abiding joy, for they were
also the days of my regeneration. Day and
night, my one thought was to destroy the big
grizzly. We never left his trail. The dogs
followed him like demons. Five times in the
first week we came within long shooting-range,
and twice we hit him. But still he did not wait
for us or attack us. He wanted to be left alone.
In that week, he killed four of the dogs, and
the others we tied up to save them. We trailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
him with horses and afoot, and never did the
spoor of other game lure me aside. The desire
to kill him became a passion in me. He
outgeneraled us. He beat all our games of
trickery. But I knew that we were bound to
win&mdash;that he was slowly weakening because of
exhaustion, and the sickness of his wounds. We
loosed the dogs again, and another was killed.</p>

<p>Then, at last, came that splendid day when
Thor, master of the mountains, showed me how
contemptible was I&mdash;with my human shape and
soul.</p>

<p>It was Sunday. I had climbed three or four
thousand feet up the side of a mountain and
below me lay the wonder of the valley, dotted
with patches of trees and carpeted with the
beauty of rich, green grass, mountain-violets
and forget-me-nots, wild asters, and hyacinths.
On three sides of me spread out the wonderful
panorama of the Canadian Rockies, softened in
the golden sunshine of late June. From up and
down the valley, from the breaks between the
peaks, and from the little gullies cleft in shale
and rock that crept up to the snow-lines came a
soft and droning murmur. It was the music of
running water&mdash;music ever in the air of summer,
for the rivers and creeks and tiny streamlets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
gushing down from the melting snow up
near the clouds are never still. Sweet perfumes
as well as music came to me; June and July&mdash;the
last of spring and the first of summer in
the northern mountains&mdash;were commingling.
All the earth was bursting with green; flowers
were turning the sunny slopes and meadows into
colored splashes of red and white and purple,
and everything that had life was giving voice
to exultation&mdash;the fat whistlers on their rocks,
the pompous little gophers on their mounds, the
squirrel-like rock-rabbits, the big bumblebees
that buzzed from flower to flower, the hawks in
the valley, and the eagles over the peaks.</p>

<p>Earth, it seemed, was at peace.</p>

<p>And I, looking over all that vastness of life,
felt my own greatness thrust upon me.</p>

<p>For had not the Creator, of all things, made
this wonderland for <em>me</em>?</p>

<p>There could be no denial. I was master&mdash;master
because I could think, because I could
reason, because I held the reins to an unutterable
power of destruction. And then the vastness
of time seized upon me like a living thing.
Yesterday, a thing had happened which came
strongly into my thoughts of to-day. Under a
great overhanging cliff I had found a part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a monster bone, as heavy as iron&mdash;a section of
a gigantic vertebra. Two years before I had
found part of the skeleton of a prehistoric
creature, identical with this, and, from photographs
which I took of it the scientific departments
of the University of Michigan and the
government at Ottawa agreed that the bones
were part of the skeleton of a mammoth whale
that once had swum where the valleys and peaks
of the Rocky Mountains now disrupt the continent.</p>

<p>And on this Sunday, looking down, I thought
of the monster bone I had found yesterday in
the dry shale and sand under the cliff. When
the Three Wise Men saw the star in the east,
that bone was as I had found it. It was there
when Christ was born. It was there, unmoved
and untouched, before Rome was founded, before
Troy died in the mists of the past, before
history, as we know history, began. It was
there a million years ago, ten million, fifty, a
hundred. And, thinking of this, I felt myself
growing smaller and smaller; my egoism died
away, and I saw these mountains obliterated
and under the blue of a vast ocean, and rising
out of that ocean I saw other continents, peopled
with other people, moved by other religions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
beating to the pulse of other civilizations
long dead. I heard the beat of waves below
me, where grew the grass and the flowers of the
valley. And the droning music of that valley
seemed to change into the low whisperings of
countless trillions of men and women and little
children who had lived and died in those other
civilizations of the lost ages; and that fancied
whispering of dead worlds told me a great
truth&mdash;that the Supreme Arbiter of things had
watched over all those trillions just as he was
now watching over me, that I was but a pitifully
small grain of dust in the great scheme of
things, that my egoism was criminal, sacrilegious,
a curse set upon myself by myself. And
the soft and droning whisper also told me the
time would come when my own “civilization”
would be obliterated, to be followed by a hundred,
a thousand, or a million others, each in
its turn to live and die.</p>

<p>And it was then, on that Sunday precious to
me, that I asked myself an old, old question in
a great, new way&mdash;“What is God?”</p>

<p>And looking down into the valley, and up into
the sky, understanding came to me. God is
there, and there, and there. He is the Infinite
Power. He is Life. Life began infinities ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and it will continue through other infinities.
While we are squabbling among ourselves with
our little religions and our little views, while
we are preaching the damnation of beliefs that
are not ours, while sects fight to convert sects
that do not think as they think, while our narrow-gage
minds travel in their narrow-gage
paths,&mdash;that Infinite Power is watching and
waiting, as it has watched and waited from the
beginning, and as it will watch and wait until
the end. And I stared down into the valley,
green and glorious and filled with sunshine and
peace, and that low-sung whisper seemed to
say, “If this is not God what <em>is</em> God?” And
then also, in a new way, came something in my
brain which said to me, “<em>And who are you?</em>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I climbed higher up the mountain. I felt
my greatness gone. Kindly, something had told
me how pitiful I was. I was not mighty. I
was no more in the ultimate of things than a
blade of grass. My egoism, on that glorious
Sunday, began to crumble in my soul. And
then, by chance if you will have it so, came the
climax of that day.</p>

<p>I came to a sheer wall of rock that rose hundreds
of feet above me. Along this ran a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
narrow ledge, and I followed it. The passage
became craggy and difficult, and in climbing
over a broken mass of rock, I slipped and fell.
I had brought a light mountain-gun with me,
and in trying to recover myself I swung it about
with such force that the stock struck a sharp
edge of rock and broke clean off. But I had
saved myself from possible death, and was in
a frame of mind to congratulate myself rather
than curse my luck. Fifty feet farther on I
came to a “pocket” in the cliff, where the ledge
widened until, at this particular place, it was
like a flat table twenty feet square. Here I sat
down, with my back to the precipitous wall, and
began to examine my broken rifle.</p>

<p>I laid it beside me, useless. Straight up at
my back rose the sheer face of the mountain;
in front of me, had I leaped from the ledge,
my body would have hurtled through empty air
for a thousand feet. In the valley I could see
the creek, like a ribbon of shimmering silver;
two or three miles away was a little lake; on
another mountain I saw a bursting cascade of
water leaping down the heights and losing itself
in the velvety green of the lower timber. For
many minutes, new and strange thoughts possessed
me. I did not look through my hunting-glasses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for I was no longer seeking game. My
blood was stirred, but not with the desire to
kill.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, there came a sound to
my ears that seemed to stop the beating of my
heart. I had not heard it until it was very
near&mdash;approaching along the narrow ledge.</p>

<p>It was the click,&mdash;click,&mdash;click of claws rattling
on rock!</p>

<p>I did not move. I hardly breathed. And
out from the ledge I had followed came a monster
bear!</p>

<p>With the swiftness of lightning, I recognized
him. It was Thor! And, in that same instant,
the great beast saw me.</p>

<p>In thirty seconds I lived a lifetime, and in
those thirty seconds what passed through my
mind was a thousand times swifter than spoken
word. A great fear rooted me, and yet in
that fear I saw everything to the minutest detail.
Thor’s massive head and shoulders were
fronting me. I saw the long naked scar where
my bullet had plowed through his shoulder; I
saw another wound in his fore leg, still ragged
and painful, where another of my soft-nosed
bullets had torn like an explosion of dynamite.
The giant grizzly was no longer fat and sleek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
as I had first seen him ten days ago. All that
time he had been fighting for his life; he was
thinner; his eyes were red; his coat was dull
and unkempt from lack of food and strength.
But at that distance, less than ten feet from me,
he seemed still a mighty brother of the mountains
themselves. As I sat stupidly, stunned to
the immobility of a rock in my hour of doom,
I felt the overwhelming conviction of what had
happened. Thor had followed me along the
ledge, and, in this hour of vengeance and
triumph, it was I, and not the great beast, who
was about to die.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that an eternity passed in
these moments. And Thor, mighty in his
strength, looked at me and did not move. And
this thing that he was looking at,&mdash;shrinking
against the rock,&mdash;was the creature that had
hunted him; this was the creature that had hurt
him, and it was so near that he could reach out
with his paw and crush it! And how weak and
white and helpless it looked now! What a pitiful,
insignificant thing it was! Where was its
strange thunder? Where was its burning lightning?
Why did it make no sound?</p>

<p>Slowly Thor’s giant head began swinging
from side to side; then he advanced&mdash;just one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
step&mdash;and in a slow, graceful movement reared
himself to his full, magnificent height. For
me, it was the beginning of the end. And in
that moment, doomed as I was, I found no pity
for myself. Here, at last, was justice! I was
about to die. I, who had destroyed so much of
life, found how helpless I was when I faced life
with my naked hands. <em>And it was justice!</em> I
had robbed the earth of more life than would
fill the bodies of a thousand men, and now my
own life was to follow that which I had destroyed.
Suddenly fear left me. I wanted to
cry out to that splendid creature that I was
sorry, and could my dry lips have framed the
words, it would not have been cowardice&mdash;but
truth.</p>

<p>I have read many stories of truth and hope
and faith and charity. From a little boy, my
father tried to teach me what it meant to be a
gentleman, and he lived what he tried to teach.
And from the days of my small boyhood,
mother told me stories of great and good men
and women, and in the days of my manhood,
she faithfully lived the great truth that of all
precious things charity and love are the most
priceless. Yet had I accepted it all in the
narrowest and littlest way. Not until this hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
on the edge of the cliff did I realize how small
can be the soul of a man buried in his egoism&mdash;or
how splendid can be the soul of a beast.</p>

<p>For Thor knew me. That I know. He knew
me as the deadliest of all his enemies on the
face of the earth. Yet until I die will I believe
that, in my helplessness, he no longer hated me
or wanted my life. For slowly he came down
upon all fours again, and, limping as he went,
he continued along the ledge&mdash;<em>and left me to
live</em>!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am not, in these days, sacrilegious enough
to think that the Supreme Power picked my poor
insignificant self from among a billion and a
half other humans especially to preach a sermon
to that glorious Sunday on the mountainside.
Possibly it was all mere chance. It may be
that another day Thor would have killed me
in my helplessness. It may all have been a
lucky accident for me. Personally, I do not believe
it, for I have found that the soul of the
average beast is cleaner of hate and of malice
than that of the average man. But whether
one believes with me or not, does not matter,
so far as the point I want to make is concerned&mdash;that
from this hour began the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
change in me, which has finally admitted me into
the peace and joy of universal brotherhood
with Life. It matters little how a sermon or a
great truth comes to one; it is the result that
counts.</p>

<p>I returned down the mountain, carrying my
broken gun with me. And everywhere I saw
that things were different. The fat whistlers,
big as woodchucks, were no longer so many
targets, watching me cautiously from the rock-tops;
the gophers, sunning themselves on their
mounds, meant more to me now than a few
hours ago. I looked off to a distant slide on
another mountain and made out the half-dozen
sheep I had studied through my glasses earlier
in the day. But my desire to kill was gone. I did
not realize the fullness of the change that was
upon me then. In a dull sort of way, I accepted
it as an effect of shock, perhaps as a passing
moment of repentance and gratitude because of
my escape. I did not tell myself that I would
never kill sheep again except when mutton was
necessary to my camp fire. I did not promise
the whistlers long lives. And yet the change
was on me, and growing stronger in my blood
with every breath I drew. The valley was different.
Its air was sweeter. Its low song of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
life and running waters and velvety winds whispering
between the mountains was new inspiration
to me. The grass was softer under my
feet; the flowers were more beautiful; the earth
itself held a new thrill for me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few nights later, beside a small fire we
had built in the cool of evening, I tried to tell
old Donald something about the Transfiguration,
how Christ had gone up on the mount with
Peter and John and James, and what had happened
there.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that Christ himself was actually
changed as he prayed on the mountain-top,”
I said to Donald. “The change was in
Peter and John and James, who in these moments
saw Christ with a new vision and a new
understanding. The Transfiguration was simply
a mental process of their own; they saw
clearly now where before they had been half
blind. And I am wondering if this old world
of ours wouldn’t change for us in the same way
if we saw it with understanding, and looked at
it with clean eyes?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So, on this other Sunday, as the evening
draws on, I look back through the years between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
me and that day on the mountain-top, and
the memory of Thor fills a warm corner of my
heart. Through him I have the happy thought
that I was given birth into a new world, and all
things now hold a new significance for me. I
have discovered for myself, in a small way,
the wonderful secret of the instinctive processes
of nature, and in a thousand ways I have found
this instinct, coming directly from the fount of
supreme direction, far more amazing than reasoning
itself. I understand more clearly, I
think, why all humanity loves a baby, no matter
how ugly it may be. It is because it is so utterly
dependent upon instinct alone, so completely
helpless, so absolutely without reason or protection
of its own. We like to believe that a
baby is very close to God, simply because it has
no reasoning and because it is as yet purely
a creature of instinctive processes. And yet, as
we lay down our lives for its protection, we forget
that adult man, with all his reasoning and
his power, was originally a creature of instinct
himself. We forget that it took millions of
years to give him a language, and that possession
of language alone has made him a super-creature.
For it is language that gives birth to
reason, allows of communication of thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and should man be suddenly bereft of all language
and thought-communication he would, in
the course of ages, revert again into a creature
guided solely by instinct. In that event he
would be nothing more or less than a brother to
all other creatures of instinct. He would again
become an ordinary member of the Ancient
Brotherhood of Common Heritage, and could
no longer call himself the Chosen One and the
Ordained of God. But good luck came to him,
perhaps even in the days when he may have
swung from the trees by his tail&mdash;good luck in
the discovery of a crude method of thought-communication,
a discovery that developed
through the ages, until now his head is turned,
so to speak, and for tens of thousands of years
he has looked down more and more upon his
poor relations who have not had his own good
fortune.</p>

<p>But I am learning that time has not freed
him, and never will free him, from his blood
relationship. And creed may follow creed, and
religion may follow religion, but never will he
find that full peace and contentment which might
be his lot until he recognizes and admits into
his comradeship again the soul of that nature
which is his own mother, and forgets his monumental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
egoism in a new understanding of those
instinctive processes of nature through which
he, himself, passed in the kindergarten of his
own existence.</p>

<p>This is my faith, my religion. Close to where
I am sitting is an old stub, clothed in a mass
of wood-vine, warm and vivid in the golden
glow of the setting sun. The wood-vine has
climbed, instinctively, to the top of the stub,
and now, finding their support gone, half a
dozen long tendrils are reaching out toward a
tall young birch six or eight feet away. One
tendril, stronger and older than the others, has
reached and clasped the nearest branch. The
others are following unerringly. <em>Yet they have
no eyes to see.</em> No voice calls back to them to
point out the way. It is the instinct of life itself
that is guiding them, the same instinct, in
a smaller way, that dragged man up bit by bit
from out of the black chaos of the past. In a
thousand other ways, if one will take the blindfold
from his eyes and try to understand, he
may see this mightiest of all the forces of the
earth&mdash;instinct&mdash;a vibrant, breathing, struggling
thing about him, a force so much more
powerful than his own, so all-consuming and
indestructible that it stands out as a giant mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
compared with the mole-hill of his own
littleness. In my own faith, I see it as a vast
and inexhaustible reservoir of life, of strength,
of “upward climb,” of inspiration. I see it as
the one great, all-necessary force of creation&mdash;a
force more precious to man than all the mines
of the earth, more precious than all the treasure
of the mints, if he would forget his greatness
and reach out his hands to it in the gladness
of a new brotherhood.</p>

<p>Dusk is falling. And, as I stop my work,
here in the heart of a forest, I seem to see the
smiles of many who will read this, and I seem
to hear the low and unbelieving laughter of
those who think themselves of the flesh and
blood of God. And I seem to hear their voices
saying:</p>

<p>“He is wrong. Nature is beautiful&mdash;sometimes.
Also, it is crude. It is rough. It is
destructive. It is, half the time, a pest. While
we&mdash;we&mdash;have we not performed wonders?
Have we not <em>proved</em> ourselves the chosen of
God? Have we not created nations? Have
we not built up great cities? Have we not accumulated
vast riches? Have we not invented
the Dollar? Are we not, in a hundred ways,
shackling nature as a man harnesses a horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
proving ourselves its masters, and it our
slave?”</p>

<p>I hear&mdash;and then I hear another voice, and
softly, distantly, it says:</p>

<p>“Yea! you are great&mdash;in your own eyes.
You have made nations and cities and great
tabernacles&mdash;and you have created the Dollar.
But, when, for a moment, you cease the mad
struggle you are making, you are <em>afraid</em>. Yes;
you cry out loudly then in your fear. You fight
to bring ghosts back, that they may tell you what
happens when you lie down and die. You cry
out for a religion which will give you absolute
faith and comfort and cannot find it. You
think you are great because you have built skyscrapers
and ride close to the clouds and have
made it possible to rush swiftly through a country
choked with dust. But you forget quickly.
You forget how little you were&mdash;yesterday.
You do not tell yourself that you are a pest, perhaps
the greatest of all. Yea; you are great,
and in your greatness you are wise, but all that
which you have achieved cannot give you that
which you so vainly seek&mdash;the contentment of
a deep and abiding faith.”</p>

<h2><em>The Fourth Trail</em><br />
THE ROAD TO FAITH</h2>


<p class="dropcap">It has been some time since I sat down to
work at my table under the tall spruce trees.
I have had an experience during the past five
or six days which is one of my rewards for
letting nature live, and, for a space, it quite
completely upset me, so far as work was concerned.</p>

<p>In other words, I have been having an experience
with a species of vermin which I love.
The baby vermin of this particular species are,
to me, almost as lovable and quite as cute in
their ways as human babies; and for the adult
vermin, the mothers and fathers of the babies,
I have a far greater love and respect than I
have for many males and females of my own
breed. And, taking it all round, they are a
cleaner, handsomer, and more wholesome-looking
lot than the average crowd of humans,
though they are&mdash;because of the mightiness of
man’s edict&mdash;nothing more than vermin.</p>

<p>I am speaking of bears. A few years ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
one of my most thrilling sports was to hunt
them&mdash;blacks, grizzlies, and polars. Now I
consider them, in a way, my brothers, and I am
having a lot of fun in the comradeship. I am
filled with resentment when I consider that in
all the states of this country, with the exception
of two or three, the law says these friends
of mine are “vermin,” along with lice and fleas
and maggots, and that they may be killed on
sight, babies and all, because,&mdash;perhaps once in
his lifetime,&mdash;a bear living very close to civilization
may make a meal of pig or lamb. If every
human mother in the land could hold a baby
cub in her arms for five minutes, there would
be such an uprising of feminine sympathy that
the laws would be repealed.</p>

<p>In thinking again of our mothers, I would
give a good year of my life if a million of them
could have seen what I have seen during the
past few days. For, after all, I believe that
nearly all great movements toward better and
bigger and more beautiful things must and will
begin with women. No amount of “equality”
will ever take that blessed superiority to men
away from them. To-day, even religion,
shameful to men as the fact may be, rests on
a pillar of women’s white shoulders, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
faith that the world possesses first finds its
resting-place in their soft breasts. And I look
ahead to the day, with unbounded faith of my
own, when women will see, and understand, and
begin the great fight toward comradeship with
all that other life which is so utterly dependent
about them now&mdash;life which throbs and urges in
every living thing from the grass-blade and the
oak to the “instinct” creatures of flesh and
blood. Then shall we have a “religion of nature,”
with a force and a might behind it which
will glorify the earth, and man will come to realize
that he is not God, but only an insignificantly
small part of God’s handiwork. And
when man comes to that point, where he casts
off his arrogance and his ego, then will the time
have come for the birth of a satisfying and universal
faith in that great and all-embracing
Power which we know and speak of in our own
language as God.</p>

<p>And the very foundation of this faith, I believe,
will be an understanding of <em>all</em> life, the
acknowledgment at last that man himself may
not be a more precious physical manifestation
of the Supreme Vital Force than many of the
other created things about him.</p>

<p>It is because I believe that nature, the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of all life, is trying to teach us this great truth
in a thousand or a million different ways, in the
smoke and grime and crush of big cities as well
as in farm-land and forest, that I come back
to my little experience with the bears.</p>

<p>About six or seven miles to the north of me is
a great ridge, plainly visible from one of the
halfway limbs of my lookout spruce, a sort of
barrier which rises up between me and the still
vaster hinterland beyond it. Sometime in the
past, a fire swept over it, so that now it is covered
with a gorgeous and splendid growth of
young birch and poplars, and virile patches of
vines on which, a little later, there will be an
abundance of strawberries, raspberries, rose-berries,
and black currants. It is also richly
sprinkled with mountain-ash trees, which give
promise of a yield of hundreds of bushels of
fruit this late summer and autumn. Altogether,
it is an ideal feeding-range for wild things,
hoof, claw, and feathers. Three times I have
traveled for miles along the cap of this ridge.
To me, in all its richness and promise, it is a
glorious manifestation of Life. It breathes
under me and about me. I can fairly hear its
compelling youth bursting from its growing
leaves, its swelling fruits, its flowers, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the mold that pulses and throbs with the vital
forces under my feet. I almost think I could
live and die on this ridge, or another ridge like
it, and never be at loss for company.</p>

<p>On my first visit to the ridge, being overtaken
by storm, I built me a brush shelter in a lovely
spot close to it, with a tiny creek of spring-cold
water not more than a dozen paces away. On
my third and last visit, I returned to this spot,
and ran face on into my adventure.</p>

<p>From the sheltered bower of balsams where
I had built my wigwam, I could look up a rolling,
meadowy breast of the ridge, so perfect
in its adornment of vine and bush and small
clumps of young trees that, to one not entirely
acquainted with the exquisite art of nature, it
would almost seem as though a human landscape-architect
had “laid out” the little paradise
which was my hillside back yard. On this
particular morning, coming up quietly, my eyes
were greeted by an amazingly pretty spectacle.
The green hillside, soft and velvety in the sunlight
and shadow of the morning, was in full
possession of two families of black bears.</p>

<p>So close were the nearest of them to me that
I dropped like a shot behind a big rock, and
the breath of air that was stirring being in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
favor, I was at a splendid vantage-point to take
in the whole scene. Within forty yards of me
were a mother and three cubs, and a little
higher up&mdash;perhaps twice that distance&mdash;were
a mother and two cubs. At almost the very
crest of the ridge were two more bears, which I
at first thought were adults. A closer inspection
assured me they were last year’s cubs, and possibly
not more than a third grown, though to
which of the two mothers they belonged, if to
either, I could not make up my mind. Frequently,
instead of setting out in life for itself,
a black bear cub will follow its mother through
a second season, and I judged this to be the situation
here.</p>

<p>For two hours, I did not move from my
place of concealment. That spectacle of
motherhood and babyhood on the hillside, with
the virile and luxuriant life of nature pulsing
and beating all about it, was a new chapter in
my book of religion. It was pointing out to me,
in perhaps a hundredth or a thousandth lesson,
that all life is the same, and that it is only
language, or the want of language, that makes
the difference in the “life-relationship” of all
created things. I could fancy, as I lay there,
just how the Supreme Arbiter of things had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
given physical being to all this life that was
about me, as well as the life that was in me.
It has all come from the same dynamo, so to
speak&mdash;a spark of it in each tree, a spark of it
in each flower and shrub, and blade of grass, a
spark of it in each of the beasts of flesh and
blood on the hillside, and a spark of it in me.
Our life was the same. It had all come from
the same vital source, from the same supreme
fount of existence. Yet how different were the
forms it animated! Close to my hand was a
beautiful rock-violet, blue as the sky, its velvety
petals freckled with tiny flecks of gold; a few
yards away, perched among the rustling leaves
of a birch, a brush-warbler filled the air with
melody; back of me, the tops of the thick
balsams whispered softly, and up there I could
hear the grunting of the mother bears, the
squealing of the little cubs, and a gentle murmuring
sound that came from the ridge itself,
as if all living things were fighting for a language,
struggling to give voice to something that
was in them.</p>

<p>I have had some amusement and a little discord
over the teapot tempests that so-called
nature-scientists occasionally stir up among
themselves over the “humanizing” of wild life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Man’s ego has possessed him so utterly that
it is distasteful to him to concede anything
“humanlike” to any creature that is not in his
own flesh and form. For my part, loving all
wild life as I do, I am proud and glad that it
does not possess more of our human qualities.
If I write honestly of what has come to me in
my own wide experience in nature, I must&mdash;no
matter how unpleasant the statement may be&mdash;confess
that wild life <em>does</em> possess a great many
characteristics that are very “human,” and the
ways of its members are in many instances
strangely the same. I could see little difference
between my bears on the hillside and two
human mothers and their children, except in
their physical appearance, and the fact that the
humans would undoubtedly have made a great
deal more noise. But the bears were handsomer&mdash;begging
the ladies’ pardon. Their sleek
coats shone like black satin in the sun, and the
cubs were cute enough to hug to death. But
they were a worry to their mothers for all that,
and especially one of them, which appeared
to be the hog-it-all member of the family nearest
me. Whenever the mother bear pawed over
a stone or pulled down a tender bush, this little
customer was always there ahead of the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the family, licking up the choicest grubs and
ants and getting the first mouthful of greens.
Half a dozen times, the mother slapped him
with her paw, rolling him over like a fat ball.
But there could have been no very great corrective
power in the cuffings, or else he was
toughened to them by usage, for he was back
on the job again without very much loss of
time.</p>

<p>For almost two hours, the bears fed on the
hillside. Several times the two families drew so
near together that the cubs intermingled and the
mothers almost rubbed sides. I feel that the
interest of this particular page would be greatly
increased for many of my readers if I added a
ferocious imaginary fight between the two
mothers and a bloody feud between the youngsters.
Bears do fight when they meet&mdash;sometimes&mdash;just
like humans, only not as often. But
it is my duty to relate that these bears were at
peace on this particular day, and that they
seemed to enjoy the mutual companionship. It
was all so fine that I had an impelling desire to
go up on the hillside and become a comrade with
them. When the feeding was over, and the
cubs were wrestling and running about in play,
I almost rose up from behind my rock to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
out my friendship to them. The lack of one
thing held me back&mdash;that one thing which all
nature is crying out for&mdash;<em>a language</em>. I feel
they would have welcomed me could I have told
them I was a friend, and wanted to play with
them, and make them a present of some
sugar. But instead of that this is what
happened:</p>

<p>In their play, two of the cubs had descended
within twenty feet of my rock. One of these
was the gourmand. Somehow, he lost his balance,
rolled over, and came tumbling down.
When he stopped he was not more than half a
dozen feet from me. As he brought his fat
little body to its feet he saw me. His eyes
fairly popped. It seemed to me that for a full
minute he did not move or breathe. And during
that same minute I remained as still as a
rock. In his amazement and his wonder, he
was the funniest thing I had ever seen, and in
spite of myself, my face broke into a grin. Instantly
there came out of him a little, piggish
grunt,&mdash;and he was off. Up that hillside he
went as if the world was after him. He did not
stop when he reached his mother and the other
cubs, but seemed to hit it still faster for the
top of the ridge. The mother looked after him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
sniffed the air, and rose to her feet. In half a
minute, she was lumbering after him, the two
remaining cubs hustling ahead of her.</p>

<p>A hundred yards away, the second mother
bear took the warning. In a very short time,
they had all disappeared over the cap of the
ridge. I had not shown myself. I had made
no sound. The wind was still in my favor.
Yet the frightened cub had given warning to
them all. For no other creature but man would
they have fled like that. Even in the face of a
pack of wolves, the mothers would have turned
to fight. Something had told them that man
was near&mdash;yet only the cub had seen and smelled
that man, and he had probably never seen or
smelled another. Yet he knew, and all the
others knew, that man was the deadliest of all
enemies. And I am half convinced, as I write
this, that nature has at least the beginning of a
universal language, that the centuries and hundreds
of centuries have given it four words, and
these words are: “Man is our enemy.” I
might fancy that the winds carry these words,
that the tree-tops whisper them, that they are
in the undertone of running waters, that all life
outside of man and man’s pitiably few friends
has, in some strange way, come to learn them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
It is, I confess, an elusive sort of fancy,&mdash;but it
sets one to thinking.</p>

<p>It makes one wonder, for instance, why man
is so jealous of himself. The Supreme Power
is immeasurable, he tells himself. It has no
such a thing as limitation. Heaven, no matter
in what form he may conceive it, is utterly
boundless. Yet he is jealous of it. He does
not want to concede that any other life will
form a part of it but that of his own breed.
He has tried, through unnumbered centuries, to
fool himself into the belief that he is the one
and only thing in all creation upon which the
Ruling Power of the universe has its guardian
eye. He has tried to make himself believe that
he is the one toad in the huge puddle of life.
He has not conceded that an all-powerful but
tender God might love flowers and birds and
trees and many other living things as well as he
loves man. And as I sit here under my spruce
trees again, it seems to me that, just because he
has been so near-sighted, man has not yet found
a faith which is all-comforting and of which he
is utterly sure.</p>

<p>I seem to see a very clear reason for this. In
this age, though still fettered by his egoism, man
is not utterly blind to his own deformities. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
“civilization” progresses, he sees more and
more what a monster he has been in the past,
and what a monster in many ways he is to-day.
He sees his breed committing every crime
known to the ages, from petty larceny to world-slaughters
that devastate nations. He sees
everywhere the strong taking advantage of the
weak. He sees millions go hungry and cold that
a few may profit. In great convention-halls, he
sees the “statesmen” that rule the destiny of a
mighty nation cutting capers and acting generally
like a lot of silly little children. He
sees every man in a great game fighting to see
who can accumulate the most dollars, no matter
at what cost to the others. He sees sickening
and disgusting fads come and go. He looks on
a world-brothel of iniquity, of discontent, of
avarice and greed and butchery among men.
Nowhere does he see the stability, the dignity,
and the mighty forces of good that should walk
hand in hand with “the chosen of God.”</p>

<p>He is beginning to see himself, at last, as a
contemptible specimen of life&mdash;in spite of his
brain and his inventions.</p>

<p>He is beginning to understand that the most
perfect airship his brain will ever conceive cannot
take him to heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>He is beginning to realize that there is a thing
greater than brain, greater than mechanical
progress.</p>

<p>And as he comes to understand more and
more how imperfect a thing he is, the more unstable
his faith becomes; and the sacrilegious
thought comes to him, unconsciously but with
terrific force: “If I am the chosen handiwork
of God, then I can have no very great faith in
the judgment and workmanship of God.”</p>

<p>And as the suspicion grows upon him that he
may not be the “one and only” child of God,
he cries out wildly in these modern days for evidence.
He tries to bring spirits back from the
dead that they may offer him some proof. He
quests vainly for “revelations” that may satisfy
him. He says with his mouth, “Yes; I
believe absolutely in God,” yet, in his heart, he
knows that he is half lying,&mdash;because of fear
of what his neighbor will think if he speaks the
truth. He wants to believe there is a God. He
wants to <em>know</em> there is a God. Yet he is
afraid.</p>

<p>And, personally, I am glad that the time has
come when he is afraid. I think it is the real
beginning of his salvation and the dropping-away
of his egoism. To-day he is beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
see all life as he did not see it yesterday. And
to-morrow his eyes will be wide open.</p>

<p>That is my faith. I believe that God is
greater than humanity has ever conceived him
to be. I think he is “a common sort of fellow,”
and I write these words with all the holy
reverence of which the soul is capable. I do
not mean to imply that I think he is in my form,
or in any particular form. But he is Life. And
it is his intention and his desire that every living
thing that is worthy of life be a part of
him. I am almost Indian in this faith. I can
hear the buoyant, cheering call of Life in a
waterfall. The inspiration of it comes into my
own body from out of a whispering tree, from
a bush glowing with bloom, from a flower, from
the song of a bird, from the rain itself. I find
great peace and contentment in my faith that
this God is everywhere, and that we may meet
him face to face fifty times a day if we throw
off the hard shell of our egoism, and realize that
all nature is God&mdash;and that we, as men and
women and children, are a part of that all-embracing
nature.</p>

<p>Even now the sun is filtering through the
tree-branches upon this partly written page. I
look at it, and I see again the inconceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
greatness of the Supreme Power, and my own
microscopic littleness. For we of the earth
have thought that the earth is great, and that
we, having inherited the earth, are of all things
greatest. Yet is that sun which warms and
lights my page as I write&mdash;more than a million
times as large as the earth&mdash;more than eight
hundred thousand miles from one end of its
diameter to the other. And the still more
stupendous fact is that this sun is itself only
a small bit of mechanism in the mighty forces
of infinity, for there are a <em>hundred million other
suns in space</em>, each lighting and warming its
own worlds&mdash;innumerable worlds&mdash;each peopled
with its own type of flesh and blood, and
each possessing, perhaps, its own peculiar
forms of “civilization” and its own savagery.</p>

<p>Just that great, and vast, and all-embracing
is the handiwork of that vital force which rules
all infinity&mdash;and to which we have given the
name of God.</p>

<p>And here I emphasize again that great truth
which nature has impressed upon me&mdash;that, just
so long as man considers himself the one and
only chosen part of God, and therefore next to
him in greatness, just that long will his egoism
and self-conceit blind him to the greatness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
glory of the real truth, and to the glory of the
faith which might be his. I believe that Christ
was a great teacher, that he was a great student
of his times, and incorporated into his teachings
all that was highest and best in the teachings
of other great men who had lived and
died before him. And I have always regretted
that Christ was unfortunate to have for his
historians a set of men who were unequal to
their task, many of them narrow-minded, moved
by “visions” and superstitions instead of fact,
men who believed in all the miracles of the
imagination from conversing with angels to
stopping the sun,&mdash;men utterly incapable of
writing down calmly and truthfully those mighty
teachings of Christ which, had they been written
as they were spoken, would have meant so much
for the world to-day. For I believe, in my own
heart, that Christ was the greatest lover of
nature that history knows of to the present day.
I believe that in the many years of his “disappearance,”
Christ was not only studying the
teachings of the past, but that, close to the
breast of nature, he was learning the splendid
truths of life&mdash;all life&mdash;which were afterward
the very heart and soul of his messages to mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe that Christ, could he return to earth
to-day, would say: “My biographers have
given you a wrong impression of me, and they
have misquoted me. What my soul was called
upon to teach nineteen hundred years ago, they
have clothed in the raiment of superstition, of
misunderstanding, and of impossible miracle.
For I am a man, even as thee and thine. But
I have found the true faith. And that faith, as
I told them then, depends utterly upon the
dropping of the scales of self from man’s eyes,
and his understanding of <em>all life</em>. For that I
gladly died.”</p>

<p>The greatest regret I have is that Christ, as
a man, did not foresee more clearly the tremendous
influence his teachings were to exert
upon humanity through the ages. Had he
guessed this, he would have written down with
his own hand those teachings which were so
carelessly left to the mercy of superstitious&mdash;frequently
fanatical&mdash;and at nearly all times
incapable biographers. For Christ, of all men
that ever lived, was undoubtedly one of the best
and the most humble. His teachings came
straight from his heart. He did not intend that
they should be smothered in hyperbole, metaphor,
and rhetorical embroidery until no two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
living men could agree absolutely upon their
meaning. I believe that he spoke simply and
directly, for only in that way could he have
reached the hearts of the masses. And I believe
that the greatest of all his lessons was the lesson
of humility. As a man, he had dropped his
egoism, had submitted himself to the Master of
all life, and in that submission he had found the
truth, and the glory of a great faith. The misfortune
of the humanity to follow in after-ages
was that the world of Jesus Christ was small&mdash;so
small that by word of mouth he could reach
from end to end of it. Had he dreamed that
there were still undiscovered worlds so great
that in comparison his own was but a handful
of dirt out of a wagon-load, I am convinced
within myself that the world to-day would not
be struggling to understand a faith written in
parables and riddles, for Christ would have set
his own hand to the task which others so poorly
accomplished.</p>

<p>With such a priceless inheritance in the form
of Christ’s own handiwork, I am equally sure
that humanity would no longer have an excuse
for its egoism, or be ashamed of that humility
which is necessary to the understanding of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and essential to the possession of a deep and
abiding faith.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have, at times, heard intelligent people express
amazement that I should dare to place
human life on an equal level with all other life,
that I should so “blaspheme the Creator” as
to say that the life in a two-legged animal who
can talk is the same as that in a flower or a
plant or a tree or some other animal which
cannot talk. I have sometimes allowed myself
to point out the innumerable advantages possessed
over man by many living things which
have no language, as we know language. I
could fill a dozen volumes with word-pictures
of the thousands and tens of thousands of advantages
which living things outside of man
possess over man, and which, if man could
achieve, would be stupendous miracles. But
man, collectively, is blinded by his egoism to the
marvelous attainments of all life that does not
walk and talk as he walks and talks. When
confronted by the incontrovertible wonder and
apparent miracle of other life as compared with
his own I have nearly always found that men
and women fall back, as a last resort, on the
absurd and shallow argument: “But this other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
life you speak of has only instinct. It cannot
talk; it cannot reason, and therefore it is impossible
for it to have a soul.”</p>

<p>Once a beautiful young matron said to me,
“There is much in your creed that is inspiring
and beautiful, but it reaches a point where it is
inconceivable, for you must concede that a
human being is the most perfect of all created
things.”</p>

<p>I gave her an exquisite rose which I had
plucked from my garden only a few minutes
before.</p>

<p>“There are, outside of men and women and
children, innumerable things more perfectly
created than this flower,” I said. “Are you, in
your youth and beauty, as perfect as that rose?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And yet I know that such arguments as these,
innumerable though they might be, cannot prevail
until men and women bring themselves face
to face with nature itself, filled with a willingness
and a yearning to understand. They point
out the pests of life&mdash;the serpent, the deadly
insects, the plants that scar and poison; yet
they cannot see themselves as perhaps the deadliest
and the most relentless of all pests. For it
is one of the mysterious laws of Creation that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
every living thing&mdash;flower, and tree, and beast,
and man&mdash;has a pest born unto it; and unto
these pests other pests are born, until at last,&mdash;when
the thing is analyzed,&mdash;a pest is a pest
only in so far as its enemy, and not its friends,
judge it to be a pest. If the world to-day were
eliminated of human pests as each individual in
the world might judge for himself, how many
of us would be left alive to-morrow?</p>

<p>And always, when I have listened to the age-old
arguments prompted by man’s egoism and
self-glorification, I love to return to the peace
and the comfort of nature, whether that nature
be in the form of a deep forest, a clover field,
an orchard, or the little back plot of a crowded
city home. And if I am where there is no cool
earth to stand my feet upon, I find my peace and
rest in the printed pages which describe that
nature-world of mine. From the most beautifully
written volumes to the honest pages and
unembellished fact of farm-journals, I have,
times without number, found enthralling interest,
consolation, and the strength and courage
of the cool and glorious earth itself.
Nature’s Bible is not hard to find. It is everywhere,
living, breathing, printed&mdash;the one universal
and ever-present Book of Life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever I think of the commonest of
human arguments: “But this other life you
speak of has only instinct. It cannot talk;
it cannot reason, and therefore it is impossible
for it to have a soul,” my mind always travels
back to a certain incident in my experience as a
refutation. I could, had I the space, answer
that argument with a hundred compelling facts;
I might answer it from the point of the flower,
the vine, the tree, the grass that carpets the
earth, but I always think first of the particular
tragedy I am going to describe, because of the
chief human actor in it, and because this actor
was, in my humble estimation, one of the most
physically perfect of her species.</p>

<p>I will not give her name. She is the daughter
of one of the best known men in the nation, and
one of the foremost scientists of the world; and
should she happen to read these lines, I hope
that she will see, with a new vision and a
new understanding, that “triumph” of years
ago.</p>

<p>I think she was about twenty when my outfit
happened to join trails with her father’s in the
far north. She will remember that early afternoon
when we camped together close to the
Cochrane, in the Reindeer Lake country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe that I am quite reasonably sure of
myself when I say that she was the most beautiful
woman I had seen up to that time or have
seen since. It is simply because of her perfection
that she has always appealed as having
furnished to me one of the most dramatic
object-lessons of my experience. She was athrill
with life. She worshiped her father. She loved
the sun, the sky, the wind, the trees, the whole
world. Life seemed to have given her everything
that it possessed&mdash;the rare coloring of the
most beautiful flower under her feet, a form
that was divine, hair and eyes that no artist
could paint, and, I think, one of the sweetest
voices I have ever heard. She is, I have heard,
beloved in her own environment. She is a
worker for human betterment, and spends much
of her time in actual work with the poor. Not
long ago she was responsible for the building
of a home for unfortunate little children.</p>

<p>That day in camp there was a sudden excitement.
Three of the Indians had driven a cow
moose, a yearling, and a bull into a small cover.
It was a splendid chance for the girl. I can
see her eyes glowing with the fires of excitement
now, as she caught up her rifle and hurried with
her father and brother and the Indians to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
refuge-place of the family of moose. She was
placed at the head of an open space, and the
moose were driven out. First came the yearling
calf, then the mother, and after them came the
old bull. The girl’s lovely face, as I looked at
it, was flushed. It seemed as though I might
hear the excited beating of her heart as she
waited, quivering with the desire to kill.</p>

<p>She fired first at the calf, and then at the
mother&mdash;and from that moment all that was
big and beautiful and noble in life seemed to
leave her own body and enter that of the old
bull moose. For the first shot had struck the
calf, laming it so that it could run but slowly,
with the mother urging it on from behind. Not
once in the moments that followed did the
mother run ahead of her calf. And then I beheld
a thing that I believe to be as noble as
anything that man has ever done in all the ages.
Believe, if you will, that the magnificent old
bull had no reason. Believe, if you cannot sacrifice
your egoism, that he did not think. Do
not give him the credit of possessing a heart or
a soul or feelings, if that sacrifice of egoism
hurts you. But consider what happened.</p>

<p>The old bull ran alongside the cow, alongside
the calf, and then, by reason or instinct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
he <em>knew</em> what had happened. He did not forge
ahead. He did not race for safety, but deliberately
he dropped behind, turned himself
broadside, and stopped, <em>making of his own
splendid body a barrier in the path of the
bullets</em>.</p>

<p>I heard the girl’s rifle cracking. Twice I
saw the bull flinch, and I knew that he was
struck. Then I heard her cry out, almost frantically,
that her last shot was gone. In the same
instant, her brother ran up from the cover and
thrust his own rifle into her hands.</p>

<p>“Give it to him, sis!” he cried. “Give it
to him!”</p>

<p>The big bull had turned. He staggered a
bit as he ran, but in a hundred feet he had overtaken
the cow and the calf. The calf was going
still more slowly, and in my desire to see the
cow and the bull break away, I shouted.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the sound of my
voice, the bull stopped again. He placed himself
broadside, at perhaps a three-quarter angle,
so that, by turning his head slightly, he was
looking back at us. He was directly between
the cow and the calf, and the girl’s bullets continued
to rip into him. I remember that I cried
out in protest, but she did not sense my words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Every fiber of her being was strung to the
thrilling achievement of that crime. She was
deaf and blind to the nobility of the great-hearted
beast who, in my eyes, was deliberately
sacrificing his life. The flaming lust to kill had
driven all other things out of her heart and soul.
Her father had run up, and brother and father
cried out in triumph when the old bull sagged
suddenly in the middle and almost fell to his
knees. Four times he had been struck when
again he went on.</p>

<p>From my experience in big-game hunting, I
knew that he was done for. Yet, even in these
moments when he was dying, the glorious soul
of him was unafraid. Three hundred yards
away he stopped and turned again, giving the
cow and the calf a last chance to reach the timber.
The girl fired her last shots, and missed.
Then the bull swung after the cow and the calf
and disappeared in the cover. But, as he went,
there came back to us a terrible, deep-chested
cough, and my heart gave up its hope. It told
me the heroic old bull was shot through the
lungs. I did not hurry after the girl and her
father and brother as they ran over the blood-stained
trail. I continued to hear the coughing
for a few moments. Then it was silent. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
I came up to them, just inside the timber, the
three were standing in triumph close to the dead
body of the bull. Hardly more than twenty
paces from it was the yearling calf, dying, but
not quite dead. The brother had ended it with
a revolver-shot.</p>

<p>And then I looked at the creature who had
committed this double murder. Many times I
had done this same crime, but with me, crude
and rough, with all the inborn savagery of man,
killing had not seemed quite so horrible. And
standing there, a little later,&mdash;red-lipped, her
face aflame, her eyes glowing, exquisite in her
beauty,&mdash;the girl had her picture taken in triumph
as she stood with one booted little foot on
the neck of her victim.</p>

<p>When I hear of the vaunted human soul, and
when men and women tell me there is no soul
but the soul of a human, my mind goes back to
that day. I might tell of a hundred other instances
that are convincing unto myself, but that
one stands out with unforgettable vividness.</p>

<p>I am sure, for instance, that the soul of a
flower once saved my life. This is not unusual,
or even remarkable, for the souls of flowers
have saved unnumbered lives, as well as giving
cheer and courage to countless millions; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
when we die it is still the Soul of the Flower
that watches over us in our resting-places. No
place in the world do flowers live more beautifully
than in our gardens of the dead, cheering
us when we come with our grief to the place of
our lost ones, giving us courage to go on. Take
the Soul of the Flower away from us, and the
world would be hard and bleak to live in.</p>

<p>To me, the soul is synonymous with life. I
do not disassociate the two. When we breathe
our last, our life&mdash;our soul&mdash;is gone. The two,
I believe, are one. When we pluck a flower we
destroy neither, but when we tear it up by the
roots so that it dies, then has its soul, or its
life, gone the same way as that of man who
dies. I have spent many wonderful hours in
those gardens of the dead which every city,
hamlet, and countryside must have. To me,
there are only beauty and the glory of God in a
cemetery. It seems to me that there, if never
before, one must come to understand the
brotherhood of all life. It seems to me that
the very stillness and peace of a resting-place
of the dead softly whisper to us the great secret
which those who are lying there have at last discovered&mdash;that
life is the same, that its only difference
is in form and manifestation. I seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
feel that I have come into the one place where
there are only charity and faith and good will,
and I have always the thought&mdash;which to me
gives courage and hope&mdash;that this is why the
flowers and the trees are so beautiful and so
comforting there. I have stood in other cemeteries
which, to the passing eye, have been
barren and ugly, where man has lent but very
feebly a helping hand, but even there, if I
looked a little closer, I have found the Soul of
the Flower, the same peace, the same tranquillity,
perhaps even greater courage to inspire one
to “keep on.”</p>

<p>I have a case in point, so convincing to myself
that all the preaching in the world could not
change my sentiment in the matter. I happened,
at this particular time, to be traveling
alone in the Northland, and when a certain accident
befell me, the nearest help I knew of was
at a half-breed’s cabin between twenty and
thirty miles away. Thirty miles is not a very
great matter in a country of paved roads and
level paths, but it is a far distance in a country
of dense forest and swamp, without trails or
guide-posts&mdash;and especially when one is badly
crippled. Like the most amateurish tenderfoot,
I took a chance along the face of a cliff near a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
small waterfall, slipped, fell, and came tumbling
down a matter of thirty feet with a sixty-pound
pack and my rifle on top of me. In the fall, my
foot received a terrific blow, probably on a projecting
ledge of rock.</p>

<p>The man who has faced many situations is
usually the man who is cautious, and though I
had just committed an inexcusable error in my
carelessness, I now lost no time in putting up
my small silk tent while I could still drag myself
about. It was well I did so. For ten days
thereafter, I was not able to rest a pound of
weight upon my injured foot.</p>

<p>With the music and refreshing coolness of
the waterfall less than a hundred feet from my
tent door, and the creek itself not more than a
quarter of that distance, I was most fortunately
situated under the circumstances. The first
morning after my fall found me almost helpless.
Every move I made gave me excruciating pain.
My entire foot and ankle, and my leg halfway to
the knee, were swollen to twice their normal
size. This first day I dragged myself to a
sapling, cut it as I lay on my side, and made
me a rough crutch of it. The second day, my
entire lower limb was swollen until it had lost
all semblance to form, and was so badly discolored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that a cold and terrible dread began to
grow in me. I had only thirty cartridges. I
fired ten that first day, in the futile hope that
some wandering adventurer might have drifted
within the sound of my rifle. Occasionally I
hallooed. Night of the second day found me in
the beginning of a fever, and, at a cost of physical
agony, I prepared myself for the worst&mdash;placed
my possessions within the reach of my
hands, and dragged myself up from the creek
with a small pail of water.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the dawn of the third day.
Racked with pain, with the fever in my blood,
my leg now stiff as a board to the thigh, I was
still not blind to the beauty of the morning. The
rising sun first lighted up the waterfall, then it
fell in a warm and golden flood where I had
made my camp. In that silence, broken only by
the music of the water, every soft note that was
made by the wild things came to me distinctly.
It was a morning to put cheer and hope into the
heart of a dying man. Then my eyes turned,
and, a few feet beyond the reach of my hand, I
<em>found something looking at me</em>.</p>

<p>Yes; to me, in that moment, it was a thing
living and vibrant with life, and yet it was nothing
more than a flower. It grew on a stem a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
foot high, and the face of it made me think of
one of our home-garden pansies; only, the
flower was all one color, with longer petals&mdash;a
soft, velvety blue. It seemed to have turned to
face the morning sun, and, in facing the sun, it
was squarely facing me&mdash;a piquant, joyous,
laughing little face, asking me as clearly as in
words, “What can possibly be the matter with
you on this fine morning?”</p>

<p>I am not going into the psychology or soul-language
of that flower. I am not going to
argue about it at all, but simply tell what it did
for me. Perhaps, if you want to lay it all to
something, you may say it was because I was out
of my head a part of the time with fever. But
that flower was my doctor through the days of
torture and hopelessness that followed. Now
and then a bird sang near me; occasionally a
wild thing would come and peer at me curiously,
then go its way. But the flower never left me,
and only turned its face partly away from me
in the hours of its evening worship. For its
God was the sun. It faced the sun in the morning,
wide-awake and open. Late in the afternoon,
it would turn a little on its stem, and
with the setting of the sun, its soft petals would
begin to close, and it would go to sleep, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
little child, with the coming of dusk. Day after
day, it grew nearer and more of a beloved
comrade to me.</p>

<p>After the fourth day, it did not, for an instant,
allow me to think that I was going to die.
Never for an instant did it lose its cheer and
confidence. It was there to say “Hello!” to
me every morning, and there to say “Good-night”
to me when the shadows grew deep&mdash;and
all through the day it talked to me, and
bobbed its little head in the whispers of the
breezes, and I had the foolish sentiment, at
times, that it was actually flirting with me. I
do not think I realized how precious it had
become to me until, one day, there came a terrific
thunder-storm. I thought the first blast of
the wind and beat of rain were going to destroy
my comrade, and, almost in a panic, I dragged
myself right and left, forgetful of pain, until
I had built a protection about my flower.</p>

<p>That was the sixth day, and, from that day,
the swelling and the pain began to leave my
limb. On the tenth, I could move about a little
on my feet. On the fifteenth, I was prepared to
undertake my journey again. I felt a real grief
in leaving that solitary flower. It had become
a part of me, had encouraged me in my blackest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
hours, had cheered and comforted me even in
the darkness of nights, because I knew it was
there&mdash;my little comrade&mdash;waiting for the sun.
For me, it had individualized itself from among
all the other flowers in the forest. And now,
when I was about to go, I saw that the flower
itself had about lived the span of its life; in a
very short time it would fade and die. On the
morning I left, the petals were drooping, and
its tiny face did not look up at the sun and at
me as brightly as before, and I fancied that
I could hear its little voice saying, “Please take
me with you.” And I did. Call it foolish and
trivial sentiment if you will, but the flower and
I went together, and afterward I wrote a novel
and called it “Flower of the North.”</p>

<p>I have often heard strong men say, “Oh, that
is merely a matter of sentiment. Life is too
hard and real for a thing like that.”</p>

<p>I agree with them to an extent. Sentiment
does not play a large part in the world to-day.
For sentiment, as that word is understood by
the millions, is the heart and soul of all that is
good and great. Without sentiment in the
hearts of a man and a woman, there cannot be
the fullness of real love between them, even
though the law has made them man and wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Without sentiment, no good act is ever done
from the heart out. Without sentiment&mdash;a
sentiment that warms the soul as a fire warms
a cold room&mdash;there will never be a deep and
comforting faith. I have seen this “co-operation
of rational power and moral feeling” make
plain faces beautiful, and I have seen the lack
of it make others hard as rock. Selfishness,
egoism, the desire to get everything possible
out of life, no matter at what expense to others,
is its antithesis.</p>

<p>As I write these last pages, I have at hand
facts which seem to show that sentiment, and
therefore faith, is as nearly dead as it has ever
been. For science in all the great nations of the
earth is planning and plotting frantically for the
extermination of their fellow men, and this, in
the hour when all the world is crying out for a
faith, is what is being achieved:</p>

<p>Deadly gases that will make gunpowder and
the rifles anachronisms, that in the next war
will depopulate whole regions, men, women,
and little children alike.</p>

<p>Perfection of the lethal ray, which will
shrivel up and paralyze human beings over vast
areas, irrespective of whether they are combatants
or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Development of plans for “germ-warfare,”
whereby whole nations will be infected by
plagues.</p>

<p>And then consider the words of one great
military scientist of the English-speaking race:
“Germ-warfare was tried on a small scale in
the late war, and its results have been promising.
The method of its use was in the poisoning
of water supplies with cholera and typhus germs,
and the loosing of dogs inoculated with rabies
and of women inoculated with syphilis into the
enemy country. <em>Here apparently is a promising
beginning from which vast developments are
to be hoped for.</em>”</p>

<p>A promising beginning&mdash;vast developments
expected for the future&mdash;typhus&mdash;rabies&mdash;the
commercial breeding of diseased women.</p>

<p>Yes; the world is crying aloud for a great
faith, even as it smashes itself into moral fragments
on the rocks of its own egoism and its
own selfishness. But there has come a rent in
its armor, and as it commits crimes and plans
for still greater crimes, it also begins to realize
its colossal wickedness. And in its terror it
shrieks aloud for a manifestation of the Divine
Power. It demands proof.</p>

<p>And again I say that the proof is so near that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the world looks over its head&mdash;and does not
see it. Not until man’s egoism crumbles will
he understand. For ghosts will not come back
from the dead to quiet his frenzies, nor will
angels descend from out of the heavens. The
Divine Power is too great and all-encompassing
for that. God, speaking of that Power as God,
is not a trickster. He is not a mountebank. He
is not a lawyer arguing his case. He is Life.
And this Life That Never Dies has no favorites.
Such is my humble faith.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A long time has passed since I wrote these
pages. All day the countryside has lain in that
sleepy, golden shimmer that is the pulse of
Indian summer. The nights are touched with
frost. There is glory in the warmth of the sun.</p>

<p>I am in a little valley that I love&mdash;Sleepy
Hollow, I call it. The farmhouse is old and
unpainted, and it has stood on its stone foundation
for almost a century. The barn is sagging
in the middle, and between the barn and the
house is an old well that a long-dead grandfather
rigged when the timber in the hollow
knew the howl of wolves and the screech of bobcats.
Crowding close up to the back of the old
house is an orchard of apple and cherry trees, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
old they could tell many an interesting story
if they could talk.</p>

<p>And all about the sides and the front of the
house are great trees&mdash;a huge cottonwood, and
ancient oaks from which the Indians may have
shot squirrels with their bows and arrows two
hundred years ago. The “woman of the
house” has been in an invalid’s chair for years,
and the husband does little but care for her.
Therefore Life has crept up and almost inundated
the place. The grass grows high and
uncut. Wild flowers bloom in the yard. Quail
come to feed with the chickens. And beyond
this, all about, is the whisper of corn fields in
growing-time, the ripples of fields of wheat and
oats and rye, the music of the mowing-machine
and the lowing of cattle. In this little old
house of Sleepy Hollow, there is a woman who
has not walked for years, and who will never
walk again; and there is a little man with a
great fierce mustache who watches her tenderly,
and who knows that he must go on watching her
until the end of her time&mdash;and yet in this house
there is happiness, and also <em>a great faith</em>. And
nature seems to rejoice in that faith. Birds
build their nests under the porches. There is
melody in the trees. At night, crickets sing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the long grass under the open windows, and the
whippoorwills come and perch on the roof
under the old sycamore.</p>

<p>Here are suffering&mdash;and peace; few of the
riches of man, but an unlimited wealth of contentment
and faith. These two, prisoned to
the end of their days, have found what all the
world is seeking. The little old house of the
hollow, even with its tragedy, is glad. And life
has made it so, the understanding of life, the
voice and living presence of life as it whispers
about me now in the golden sheen of Indian
summer.</p>

<p>And its whisper seems to be, “Men are seeking
me, reaching out for me, crying for me&mdash;yet
they do not find me. They are looking far,
and I am very near&mdash;so far that they look over
and beyond me when I am waiting at their feet.
When at last they see me, and understand, then
will they have discovered the greatest of all
treasures&mdash;Faith!”</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
